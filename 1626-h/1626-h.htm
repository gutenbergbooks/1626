    <h2>
      PREFACE TO &ldquo;AFTER DARK.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      I have taken some pains to string together the various stories contained
      in this Volume on a single thread of interest, which, so far as I know,
      has at least the merit of not having been used before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pages entitled &ldquo;Leah&rsquo;s Diary&rdquo; are, however, intended to fulfill
      another purpose besides that of serving as the frame-work for my
      collection of tales. In this part of the book, and subsequently in the
      Prologues to the stories, it has been my object to give the reader one
      more glimpse at that artist-life which circumstances have afforded me
      peculiar opportunities of studying, and which I have already tried to
      represent, under another aspect, in my fiction, &ldquo;Hide-and-Seek.&rdquo; This time
      I wish to ask some sympathy for the joys and sorrows of a poor traveling
      portrait-painter&mdash;presented from his wife&rsquo;s point of view in &ldquo;Leah&rsquo;s
      Diary,&rdquo; and supposed to be briefly and simply narrated by himself in the
      Prologues to the stories. I have purposely kept these two portions of the
      book within certain limits; only giving, in the one case, as much as the
      wife might naturally write in her diary at intervals of household leisure;
      and, in the other, as much as a modest and sensible man would be likely to
      say about himself and about the characters he met with in his wanderings.
      If I have been so fortunate as to make my idea intelligible by this brief
      and simple mode of treatment, and if I have, at the same time, achieved
      the necessary object of gathering several separate stories together as
      neatly-fitting parts of one complete whole, I shall have succeeded in a
      design which I have for some time past been very anxious creditably to
      fulfill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the tales themselves, taken individually, I have only to say, by way of
      necessary explanation, that &ldquo;The Lady of Glenwith Grange&rdquo; is now offered
      to the reader for the first time; and that the other stories have appeared
      in the columns of <i>Household Words</i>. My best thanks are due to Mr.
      Charles Dickens for his kindness in allowing me to set them in their
      present frame-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must also gratefully acknowledge an obligation of another kind to the
      accomplished artist, Mr. W. S. Herrick, to whom I am indebted for the
      curious and interesting facts on which the tales of &ldquo;The Terribly Strange
      Bed&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Yellow Mask&rdquo; are founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the statement may appear somewhat superfluous to those who know
      me, it may not be out of place to add, in conclusion, that these stories
      are entirely of my own imagining, constructing, and writing. The fact that
      the events of some of my tales occur on foreign ground, and are acted out
      by foreign personages, appears to have suggested in some quarters the
      inference that the stories themselves might be of foreign origin. Let me,
      once for all, assure any readers who may honor me with their attention,
      that in this, and in all other cases, they may depend on the genuineness
      of my literary offspring. The little children of my brain may be weakly
      enough, and may be sadly in want of a helping hand to aid them in their
      first attempts at walking on the stage of this great world; but, at any
      rate, they are not borrowed children. The members of my own literary
      family are indeed increasing so fast as to render the very idea of
      borrowing quite out of the question, and to suggest serious apprehension
      that I may not have done adding to the large book-population, on my own
      sole responsibility, even yet.

    <p>
      LEAVES FROM LEAH&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </p>
    <p>
      16th February, 1827.&mdash;The doctor has just called for the third time
      to examine my husband&rsquo;s eyes. Thank God, there is no fear at present of my
      poor William losing his sight, provided he can be prevailed on to attend
      rigidly to the medical instructions for preserving it. These instructions,
      which forbid him to exercise his profession for the next six months at
      least, are, in our case, very hard to follow. They will but too probably
      sentence us to poverty, perhaps to actual want; but they must be borne
      resignedly, and even thankfully, seeing that my husband&rsquo;s forced cessation
      from work will save him from the dreadful affliction of loss of sight. I
      think I can answer for my own cheerfulness and endurance, now that we know
      the worst. Can I answer for our children also? Surely I can, when there
      are only two of them. It is a sad confession to make, but now, for the
      first time since my marriage, I feel thankful that we have no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      17th.&mdash;A dread came over me last night, after I had comforted William
      as well as I could about the future, and had heard him fall off to sleep,
      that the doctor had not told us the worst. Medical men do sometimes
      deceive their patients, from what has always seemed to me to be
      misdirected kindness of heart. The mere suspicion that I had been trifled
      with on the subject of my husband&rsquo;s illness, caused me such uneasiness,
      that I made an excuse to get out, and went in secret to the doctor.
      Fortunately, I found him at home, and in three words I confessed to him
      the object of my visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, and said I might make myself easy; he had told us the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that worst,&rdquo; I said, to make certain, &ldquo;is, that for the next six
      months my husband must allow his eyes to have the most perfect repose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; the doctor answered. &ldquo;Mind, I don&rsquo;t say that he may not
      dispense with his green shade, indoors, for an hour or two at a time, as
      the inflammation gets subdued. But I do most positively repeat that he
      must not <i>employ</i> his eyes. He must not touch a brush or pencil; he
      must not think of taking another likeness, on any consideration whatever,
      for the next six months. His persisting in finishing those two portraits,
      at the time when his eyes first began to fail, was the real cause of all
      the bad symptoms that we have had to combat ever since. I warned him (if
      you remember, Mrs. Kerby?) when he first came to practice in our
      neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you did, sir,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But what was a poor traveling
      portrait-painter like my husband, who lives by taking likenesses first in
      one place and then in another, to do? Our bread depended on his using his
      eyes, at the very time when you warned him to let them have a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no other resources? No money but the money Mr. Kerby can get by
      portrait-painting?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; I answered, with a sinking at my heart as I thought of his bill
      for medical attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you pardon me?&rdquo; he said, coloring and looking a little uneasy, &ldquo;or,
      rather, will you ascribe it to the friendly interest I feel in you, if I
      ask whether Mr. Kerby realizes a comfortable income by the practice of his
      profession? Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he went on anxiously, before I could reply&mdash;&ldquo;pray
      don&rsquo;t think I make this inquiry from a motive of impertinent curiosity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt quite satisfied that he could have no improper motive for asking
      the question, and so answered it at once plainly and truly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband makes but a small income,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Famous London
      portrait-painters get great prices from their sitters; but poor unknown
      artists, who only travel about the country, are obliged to work hard and
      be contented with very small gains. After we have paid all that we owe
      here, I am afraid we shall have little enough left to retire on, when we
      take refuge in some cheaper place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the good doctor (I am so glad and proud to remember
      that I always liked him from the first!), &ldquo;in that case, don&rsquo;t make
      yourself anxious about my bill when you are thinking of clearing off your
      debts here. I can afford to wait till Mr. Kerby&rsquo;s eyes are well again, and
      I shall then ask him for a likeness of my little daughter. By that
      arrangement we are sure to be both quits, and both perfectly satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He considerately shook hands and bade me farewell before I could say half
      the grateful words to him that were on my lips. Never, never shall I
      forget that he relieved me of my two heaviest anxieties at the most
      anxious time of my life. The merciful, warm-hearted man! I could almost
      have knelt down and kissed his doorstep, as I crossed it on my way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      18th.&mdash;If I had not resolved, after what happened yesterday, to look
      only at the cheerful side of things for the future, the events of to-day
      would have robbed me of all my courage, at the very outset of our
      troubles. First, there was the casting up of our bills, and the discovery,
      when the amount of them was balanced against all the money we have saved
      up, that we shall only have between three and four pounds left in the
      cash-box, after we have got out of debt. Then there was the sad necessity
      of writing letters in my husband&rsquo;s name to the rich people who were ready
      to employ him, telling them of the affliction that had overtaken him, and
      of the impossibility of his executing their orders for portraits for the
      next six months to come. And, lastly, there was the heart-breaking
      business for me to go through of giving our landlord warning, just as we
      had got comfortably settled in our new abode. If William could only have
      gone on with his work, we might have stopped in this town, and in these
      clean, comfortable lodgings for at least three or four months. We have
      never had the use of a nice empty garret before, for the children to play
      in; and I never met with any landlady so pleasant to deal with in the
      kitchen as the landlady here. And now we must leave all this comfort and
      happiness, and go&mdash;I hardly know where. William, in his bitterness,
      says to the workhouse; but that shall never be, if I have to go out to
      service to prevent it. The darkness is coming on, and we must save in
      candles, or I could write much more. Ah, me! what a day this has been. I
      have had but one pleasant moment since it began; and that was in the
      morning, when I set my little Emily to work on a bead purse for the kind
      doctor&rsquo;s daughter. My child, young as she is, is wonderfully neat-handed
      at stringing beads; and even a poor little empty purse as a token of our
      gratitude, is better than nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      19th.&mdash;A visit from our best friend&mdash;our only friend here&mdash;the
      doctor. After he had examined William&rsquo;s eyes, and had reported that they
      were getting on as well as can be hoped at present, he asked where we
      thought of going to live? I said in the cheapest place we could find, and
      added that I was about to make inquiries in the by-streets of the town
      that very day. &ldquo;Put off those inquiries,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;till you hear from me
      again. I am going now to see a patient at a farmhouse five miles off. (You
      needn&rsquo;t look at the children, Mrs. Kerby, it&rsquo;s nothing infectious&mdash;only
      a clumsy lad, who has broken his collarbone by a fall from a horse.) They
      receive lodgers occasionally at the farmhouse, and I know no reason why
      they should not be willing to receive you. If you want to be well housed
      and well fed at a cheap rate, and if you like the society of honest,
      hearty people, the farm of Appletreewick is the very place for you. Don&rsquo;t
      thank me till you know whether I can get you these new lodgings or not.
      And in the meantime settle all your business affairs here, so as to be
      able to move at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo; With those words the kind-hearted
      gentleman nodded and went out. Pray heaven he may succeed at the
      farmhouse! We may be sure of the children&rsquo;s health, at least, if we live
      in the country. Talking of the children, I must not omit to record that
      Emily has nearly done one end of the bead purse already.
    </p>
    <p>
      20th.&mdash;A note from the doctor, who is too busy to call. Such good
      news! They will give us two bedrooms, and board us with the family at
      Appletreewick for seventeen shillings a week. By my calculations, we shall
      have three pounds sixteen shillings left, after paying what we owe here.
      That will be enough, at the outset, for four weeks&rsquo; living at the
      farmhouse, with eight shillings to spare besides. By embroidery-work I can
      easily make nine shillings more to put to that, and there is a fifth week
      provided for. Surely, in five weeks&rsquo; time&mdash;considering the number of
      things I can turn my hand to&mdash;we may hit on some plan for getting a
      little money. This is what I am always telling my husband, and what, by
      dint of constantly repeating it, I am getting to believe myself. William,
      as is but natural, poor fellow, does not take so lighthearted view of the
      future as I do. He says that the prospect of sitting idle and being kept
      by his wife for months to come, is something more wretched and hopeless
      than words can describe. I try to raise his spirits by reminding him of
      his years of honest hard work for me and the children, and of the doctor&rsquo;s
      assurance that his eyes will get the better, in good time, of their
      present helpless state. But he still sighs and murmurs&mdash;being one of
      the most independent and high spirited of men&mdash;about living a burden
      on his wife. I can only answer, what in my heart of hearts I feel, that I
      took him for Better and for Worse; that I have had many years of the
      Better, and that, even in our present trouble, the Worse shows no signs of
      coming yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      The bead purse is getting on fast. Red and blue, in a pretty striped
      pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      21st.&mdash;A busy day. We go to Appletreewick to-morrow. Paying bills and
      packing up. All poor William&rsquo;s new canvases and painting-things huddled
      together into a packing-case. He looked so sad, sitting silent with his
      green shade on, while his old familiar working materials were disappearing
      around him, as if he and they were never to come together again, that the
      tears would start into my eyes, though I am sure I am not one of the
      crying sort. Luckily, the green shade kept him from seeing me: and I took
      good care, though the effort nearly choked me, that he should not hear I
      was crying, at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bead purse is done. How are we to get the steel rings and tassels for
      it? I am not justified now in spending sixpence unnecessarily, even for
      the best of purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      22d.&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      23d. <i>The Farm of Appletreewick.</i>&mdash;Too tired, after our move
      yesterday, to write a word in my diary about our journey to this
      delightful place. But now that we are beginning to get settled, I can
      manage to make up for past omissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first occupation on the morning of the move had, oddly enough, nothing
      to do with our departure for the farmhouse. The moment breakfast was over
      I began the day by making Emily as smart and nice-looking as I could, to
      go to the doctor&rsquo;s with the purse. She had her best silk frock on, showing
      the mending a little in some places, I am afraid, and her straw hat
      trimmed with my bonnet ribbon. Her father&rsquo;s neck-scarf, turned and joined
      so that nobody could see it, made a nice mantilla for her; and away she
      went to the doctor&rsquo;s, with her little, determined step, and the purse in
      her hand (such a pretty hand that it is hardly to be regretted I had no
      gloves for her). They were delighted with the purse&mdash;which I ought to
      mention was finished with some white beads; we found them in rummaging
      among our boxes, and they made beautiful rings and tassels, contrasting
      charmingly with the blue and red of the rest of the purse. The doctor and
      his little girl were, as I have said, delighted with the present; and they
      gave Emily, in return, a workbox for herself, and a box of sugar-plums for
      her baby sister. The child came back all flushed with the pleasure of the
      visit, and quite helped to keep up her father&rsquo;s spirits with talking to
      him about it. So much for the highly interesting history of the bead
      purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the afternoon the light cart from the farmhouse came to fetch us
      and our things to Appletreewick. It was quite a warm spring day, and I had
      another pang to bear as I saw poor William helped into the cart, looking
      so sickly and sad, with his miserable green shade, in the cheerful
      sunlight. &ldquo;God only knows, Leah, how this will succeed with us,&rdquo; he said,
      as we started; then sighed, and fell silent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just outside the town the doctor met us. &ldquo;Good luck go with you!&rdquo; he
      cried, swinging his stick in his usual hasty way; &ldquo;I shall come and see
      you as soon as you are all settled at the farmhouse.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good-by, sir,&rdquo; says
      Emily, struggling up with all her might among the bundles in the bottom of
      the cart; &ldquo;good-by, and thank you again for the work-box and the
      sugar-plums.&rdquo; That was my child all over! she never wants telling. The
      doctor kissed his hand, and gave another flourish with his stick. So we
      parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I should have enjoyed the drive if William could only have looked, as
      I did, at the young firs on the heath bending beneath the steady breeze;
      at the shadows flying over the smooth fields; at the high white clouds
      moving on and on, in their grand airy procession over the gladsome blue
      sky! It was a hilly road, and I begged the lad who drove us not to press
      the horse; so we were nearly an hour, at our slow rate of going, before we
      drew up at the gate of Appletreewick.
    </p>
    <p>
      24th February to 2d March.&mdash;We have now been here long enough to know
      something of the place and the people. First, as to the place: Where the
      farmhouse now is, there was once a famous priory. The tower is still
      standing, and the great room where the monks ate and drank&mdash;used at
      present as a granary. The house itself seems to have been tacked on to the
      ruins anyhow. No two rooms in it are on the same level. The children do
      nothing but tumble about the passages, because there always happens to be
      a step up or down, just at the darkest part of every one of them. As for
      staircases, there seems to me to be one for each bedroom. I do nothing but
      lose my way&mdash;and the farmer says, drolling, that he must have
      sign-posts put up for me in every corner of the house from top to bottom.
      On the ground-floor, besides the usual domestic offices, we have the best
      parlor&mdash;a dark, airless, expensively furnished solitude, never
      invaded by anybody; the kitchen, and a kind of hall, with a fireplace as
      big as the drawing-room at our town lodgings. Here we live and take our
      meals; here the children can racket about to their hearts&rsquo; content; here
      the dogs come lumbering in, whenever they can get loose; here wages are
      paid, visitors are received, bacon is cured, cheese is tasted, pipes are
      smoked, and naps are taken every evening by the male members of the
      family. Never was such a comfortable, friendly dwelling-place devised as
      this hall; I feel already as if half my life had been passed in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out-of-doors, looking beyond the flower-garden, lawn, back yards,
      pigeon-houses, and kitchen-gardens, we are surrounded by a network of
      smooth grazing-fields, each shut off from the other by its neat hedgerow
      and its sturdy gate. Beyond the fields the hills seem to flow away gently
      from us into the far blue distance, till they are lost in the bright
      softness of the sky. At one point, which we can see from our bedroom
      windows, they dip suddenly into the plain, and show, over the rich marshy
      flat, a strip of distant sea&mdash;a strip sometimes blue, sometimes gray;
      sometimes, when the sun sets, a streak of fire; sometimes, on showery
      days, a flash of silver light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inhabitants of the farmhouse have one great and rare merit&mdash;they
      are people whom you can make friends with at once. Between not knowing
      them at all, and knowing them well enough to shake hands at first sight,
      there is no ceremonious interval or formal gradation whatever. They
      received us, on our arrival, exactly as if we were old friends returned
      from some long traveling expedition. Before we had been ten minutes in the
      hall, William had the easiest chair and the snuggest corner; the children
      were eating bread-and-jam on the window-seat; and I was talking to the
      farmer&rsquo;s wife, with the cat on my lap, of the time when Emily had the
      measles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family numbers seven, exclusive of the indoor servants, of course.
      First came the farmer and his wife&mdash;he is a tall, sturdy,
      loud-voiced, active old man&mdash;she the easiest, plumpest and gayest
      woman of sixty I ever met with. They have three sons and two daughters.
      The two eldest of the young men are employed on the farm; the third is a
      sailor, and is making holiday-time of it just now at Appletreewick. The
      daughters are pictures of health and freshness. I have but one complaint
      to make against them&mdash;they are beginning to spoil the children
      already.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this tranquil place, and among these genial, natural people, how
      happily my time might be passed, were it not for the saddening sight of
      William&rsquo;s affliction, and the wearing uncertainty of how we are to provide
      for future necessities! It is a hard thing for my husband and me, after
      having had the day made pleasant by kind words and friendly offices, to
      feel this one anxious thought always forcing itself on us at night: Shall
      we have the means of stopping in our new home in a month&rsquo;s time?
    </p>
    <p>
      3d.&mdash;A rainy day; the children difficult to manage; William miserably
      despondent. Perhaps he influenced me, or perhaps I felt my little troubles
      with the children more than usual: but, however it was, I have not been so
      heavy-hearted since the day when my husband first put on the green shade.
      A listless, hopeless sensation would steal over me; but why write about
      it? Better to try and forget it. There is always to-morrow to look to when
      to-day is at the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      4th.&mdash;To-morrow has proved worthy of the faith I put in it. Sunshine
      again out-of-doors; and as clear and true a reflection of it in my own
      heart as I can hope to have just at this time. Oh! that month, that one
      poor month of respite! What are we to do at the end of the month?
    </p>
    <p>
      5th.&mdash;I made my short entry for yesterday in the afternoon just
      before tea-time, little thinking of events destined to happen with the
      evening that would be really worth chronicling, for the sake of the
      excellent results to which they are sure to lead. My tendency is to be too
      sanguine about everything, I know; but I am, nevertheless, firmly
      persuaded that I can see a new way out of our present difficulties&mdash;a
      way of getting money enough to keep us all in comfort at the farmhouse
      until William&rsquo;s eyes are well again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new project which is to relieve us from all uncertainties for the next
      six months actually originated with <i>me!</i> It has raised me many
      inches higher in my own estimation already. If the doctor only agrees with
      my view of the case when he comes to-morrow, William will allow himself to
      be persuaded, I know; and then let them say what they please, I will
      answer for the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how the new idea first found its way into my head:
    </p>
    <p>
      We had just done tea. William, in much better spirits than usual, was
      talking with the young sailor, who is jocosely called here by the very
      ugly name of &ldquo;Foul-weather Dick.&rdquo; The farmer and his two eldest sons were
      composing themselves on the oaken settles for their usual nap. The dame
      was knitting, the two girls were beginning to clear the tea-table, and I
      was darning the children&rsquo;s socks. To all appearance, this was not a very
      propitious state of things for the creation of new ideas, and yet my idea
      grew out of it, for all that. Talking with my husband on various subjects
      connected with life in ships, the young sailor began giving us a
      description of his hammock; telling us how it was slung; how it was
      impossible to get into it any other way than &ldquo;stern foremost&rdquo; (whatever
      that may mean); how the rolling of the ship made it rock like a cradle;
      and how, on rough nights, it sometimes swayed to and fro at such a rate as
      to bump bodily against the ship&rsquo;s side and wake him up with the sensation
      of having just received a punch on the head from a remarkably hard fist.
      Hearing all this, I ventured to suggest that it must be an immense relief
      to him to sleep on shore in a good, motionless, solid four-post bed. But,
      to my surprise, he scoffed at the idea; said he never slept comfortably
      out of his hammock; declared that he quite missed his occasional punch on
      the head from the ship&rsquo;s side; and ended by giving a most comical account
      of all the uncomfortable sensations he felt when he slept in a four-post
      bed. The odd nature of one of the young sailor&rsquo;s objections to sleeping on
      shore reminded my husband (as indeed it did me too) of the terrible story
      of a bed in a French gambling-house, which he once heard from a gentleman
      whose likeness he took.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re laughing at me,&rdquo; says honest Foul-weather Dick, seeing William
      turn toward me and smile.&mdash;&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; says my husband; &ldquo;that last
      objection of yours to the four-post beds on shore seems by no means
      ridiculous to <i>me,</i> at any rate. I once knew a gentleman, Dick, who
      practically realized your objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; says Dick, after a pause, and with an appearance of
      great bewilderment and curiosity; &ldquo;but could you put &lsquo;practically
      realized&rsquo; into plain English, so that a poor man like me might have a
      chance of understanding you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; says my husband,
      laughing. &ldquo;I mean that I once knew a gentleman who actually saw and felt
      what you say in jest you are afraid of seeing and feeling whenever you
      sleep in a four-post bed. Do you understand that?&rdquo; Foul-weather Dick
      understood it perfectly, and begged with great eagerness to hear what the
      gentleman&rsquo;s adventure really was. The dame, who had been listening to our
      talk, backed her son&rsquo;s petition; the two girls sat down expectant at the
      half-cleared tea-table; even the farmer and his drowsy sons roused
      themselves lazily on the settle&mdash;my husband saw that he stood fairly
      committed to the relation of the story, so he told it without more ado.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have often heard him relate that strange adventure (William is the best
      teller of a story I ever met with) to friends of all ranks in many
      different parts of England, and I never yet knew it fail of producing an
      effect. The farmhouse audience were, I may almost say, petrified by it. I
      never before saw people look so long in the same direction, and sit so
      long in the same attitude, as they did. Even the servants stole away from
      their work in the kitchen, and, unrebuked by master or mistress, stood
      quite spell-bound in the doorway to listen. Observing all this in silence,
      while my husband was going on with his narrative, the thought suddenly
      flashed across me, &ldquo;Why should William not get a wider audience for that
      story, as well as for others which he has heard from time to time from his
      sitters, and which he has hitherto only repeated in private among a few
      friends? People tell stories in books and get money for them. What if we
      told our stories in a book? and what if the book sold? Why freedom,
      surely, from the one great anxiety that is now preying on us! Money enough
      to stop at the farmhouse till William&rsquo;s eyes are fit for work again!&rdquo; I
      almost jumped up from my chair as my thought went on shaping itself in
      this manner. When great men make wonderful discoveries, do they feel
      sensations like mine, I wonder? Was Sir Isaac Newton within an ace of
      skipping into the air when he first found out the law of gravitation? Did
      Friar Bacon long to dance when he lit the match and heard the first charge
      of gunpowder in the world go off with a bang?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to put a strong constraint on myself, or I should have communicated
      all that was passing in my mind to William before our friends at the
      farmhouse. But I knew it was best to wait until we were alone, and I did
      wait. What a relief it was when we all got up at last to say good-night!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment we were in our own room, I could not stop to take so much as a
      pin out of my dress before I began. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I never heard you
      tell that gambling-house adventure so well before. What an effect it had
      upon our friends! what an effect, indeed, it always has wherever you tell
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far he did not seem to take much notice. He just nodded, and began to
      pour out some of the lotion in which he always bathes his poor eyes the
      last thing at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as for that, William,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;all your stories seem to interest
      people. What a number you have picked up, first and last, from different
      sitters, in the fifteen years of your practice as a portrait-painter! Have
      you any idea how many stories you really do know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No: he could not undertake to say how many just then. He gave this answer
      in a very indifferent tone, dabbing away all the time at his eyes with the
      sponge and lotion. He did it so awkwardly and roughly, as it seemed to me,
      that I took the sponge from him and applied the lotion tenderly myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you turned over one of your stories carefully
      in your mind beforehand&mdash;say the one you told to-night, for example&mdash;that
      you could repeat it all to me so perfectly and deliberately that I should
      be able to take it down in writing from your lips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes: of course he could. But why ask that question?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I should like to have all the stories that you have been in the
      habit of relating to our friends set down fairly in writing, by way of
      preserving them from ever being forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Would I bathe his left eye now, because that felt the hottest to-night? I
      began to forbode that his growing indifference to what I was saying would
      soon end in his fairly going to sleep before I had developed my new idea,
      unless I took some means forthwith of stimulating his curiosity, or, in
      other words, of waking him into a proper state of astonishment and
      attention. &ldquo;William,&rdquo; said I, without another syllable of preface, &ldquo;I have
      got a new plan for finding all the money we want for our expenses here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jerked his head up directly, and looked at me. What plan?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This: The state of your eyes prevents you for the present from following
      your profession as an artist, does it not? Very well. What are you to do
      with your idle time, my dear? Turn author! And how are you to get the
      money we want? By publishing a book!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Leah! are you out of your senses?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put my arm round his neck and sat down on his knee (the course I always
      take when I want to persuade him to anything with as few words as
      possible).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, William, listen patiently to me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;An artist lies under this
      great disadvantage in case of accidents&mdash;his talents are of no
      service to him unless he can use his eyes and fingers. An author, on the
      other hand, can turn his talents to account just as well by means of other
      people&rsquo;s eyes and fingers as by means of his own. In your present
      situation, therefore, you have nothing for it, as I said before, but to
      turn author. Wait! and hear me out. The book I want you to make is a book
      of all your stories. You shall repeat them, and I will write them down
      from your dictation. Our manuscript shall be printed; we will sell the
      book to the public, and so support ourselves honorably in adversity, by
      doing the best we can to interest and amuse others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I was saying all this&mdash;I suppose in a very excitable manner&mdash;my
      husband looked, as our young sailor-friend would phrase it, quite <i>taken
      aback.</i> &ldquo;You were always quick at contriving, Leah,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but how
      in the world came you to think of this plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of it while you were telling them the gambling-house adventure
      downstairs,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an ingenious idea, and a bold idea,&rdquo; he went on, thoughtfully. &ldquo;But
      it is one thing to tell a story to a circle of friends, and another thing
      to put it into a printed form for an audience of strangers. Consider, my
      dear, that we are neither of us used to what is called writing for the
      press.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but nobody is used to it when they first begin, and
      yet plenty of people have tried the hazardous literary experiment
      successfully. Besides, in our case, we have the materials ready to our
      hands; surely we can succeed in shaping them presentably if we aim at
      nothing but the simple truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is to do the eloquent descriptions and the striking reflections, and
      all that part of it?&rdquo; said William, perplexedly shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody!&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;The eloquent descriptions and the striking
      reflections are just the parts of a story-book that people never read.
      Whatever we do, let us not, if we can possibly help it, write so much as a
      single sentence that can be conveniently skipped. Come! come!&rdquo; I
      continued, seeing him begin to shake his head again; &ldquo;no more objections,
      William, I am too certain of the success of my plan to endure them. If you
      still doubt, let us refer the new project to a competent arbitrator. The
      doctor is coming to see you to-morrow. I will tell him all that I have
      told you; and if you will promise on your side, I will engage on mine to
      be guided entirely by his opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William smiled, and readily gave the promise. This was all I wanted to
      send me to bed in the best spirits. For, of course, I should never have
      thought of mentioning the doctor as an arbitrator, if I had not known
      beforehand that he was sure to be on my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      6th.&mdash;The arbitrator has shown that he deserved my confidence in him.
      He ranked himself entirely on my side before I had half done explaining to
      him what my new project really was. As to my husband&rsquo;s doubts and
      difficulties, the dear good man would not so much as hear them mentioned.
      &ldquo;No objections,&rdquo; he cried, gayly; &ldquo;set to work, Mr. Kerby, and make your
      fortune. I always said your wife was worth her weight in gold&mdash;and
      here she is now, all ready to get into the bookseller&rsquo;s scales and prove
      it. Set to work! set to work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said William, beginning at last to catch the
      infection of our enthusiasm. &ldquo;But when my part of the work and my wife&rsquo;s
      has been completed, what are we to do with the produce of our labor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; answered the doctor. &ldquo;Finish your book and send it to
      my house; I will show it at once to the editor of our country newspaper.
      He has plenty of literary friends in London, and he will be just the man
      to help you. By-the-by,&rdquo; added the doctor, addressing me, &ldquo;you think of
      everything, Mrs. Kerby; pray have you thought of a name yet for the new
      book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that question it was my turn to be &ldquo;taken aback.&rdquo; The idea of naming
      the book had never once entered my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good title is of vast importance,&rdquo; said the doctor, knitting his brows
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;We must all think about that. What shall it be? eh, Mrs.
      Kerby, what shall it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps something may strike us after we have fairly set to work,&rdquo; my
      husband suggested. &ldquo;Talking of work,&rdquo; he continued, turning to me, &ldquo;how
      are you to find time, Leah, with your nursery occupations, for writing
      down all the stories as I tell them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking of that this morning,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and have come to the
      conclusion that I shall have but little leisure to write from your
      dictation in the day-time. What with dressing and washing the children,
      teaching them, giving them their meals, taking them out to walk, and
      keeping them amused at home&mdash;to say nothing of sitting sociably at
      work with the dame and her two girls in the afternoon&mdash;I am afraid I
      shall have few opportunities of doing my part of the book between
      breakfast and tea-time. But when the children are in bed, and the farmer
      and his family are reading or dozing, I should have at least three
      unoccupied hours to spare. So, if you don&rsquo;t mind putting off our
      working-time till after dark&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the title!&rdquo; shouted the doctor, jumping out of his chair as if he
      had been shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; cried I, looking all round me in the surprise of the moment, as
      if I had expected to see the title magically inscribed for us on the walls
      of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your last words, to be sure!&rdquo; rejoined the doctor. &ldquo;You said just now
      that you would not have leisure to write from Mr. Kerby&rsquo;s dictation till
      <i>after dark.</i> What can we do better than name the book after the time
      when the book is written? Call it boldly, <i>After dark.</i> Stop! before
      anybody says a word for or against it, let us see how the name looks on
      paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened my writing-desk in a great flutter. The doctor selected the
      largest sheet of paper and the broadest-nibbed pen he could find, and
      wrote in majestic round-text letters, with alternate thin and thick
      strokes beautiful to see, the two cabalistic words
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     AFTER DARK.
</pre>
    <p>
      We all three laid our heads together over the paper, and in breathless
      silence studied the effect of the round-text: William raising his green
      shade in the excitement of the moment, and actually disobeying the
      doctor&rsquo;s orders about not using his eyes, in the doctor&rsquo;s own presence!
      After a good long stare, we looked round solemnly in each other&rsquo;s faces
      and nodded. There was no doubt whatever on the subject after seeing the
      round-text. In one happy moment the doctor had hit on the right name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written the title-page,&rdquo; said our good friend, taking up his hat
      to go. &ldquo;And now I leave it to you two to write the book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since then I have mended four pens and bought a quire of letter-paper at
      the village shop. William is to ponder well over his stories in the
      daytime, so as to be quite ready for me &ldquo;after dark.&rdquo; We are to commence
      our new occupation this evening. My heart beats fast and my eyes moisten
      when I think of it. How many of our dearest interests depend upon the one
      little beginning that we are to make to-night!

    <h2>
      PROLOGUE TO THE FIRST STORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before I begin, by the aid of my wife&rsquo;s patient attention and ready pen,
      to relate any of the stories which I have heard at various times from
      persons whose likenesses I have been employed to take, it will not be
      amiss if I try to secure the reader&rsquo;s interest in the following pages, by
      briefly explaining how I became possessed of the narrative matter which
      they contain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of myself I have nothing to say, but that I have followed the profession
      of a traveling portrait-painter for the last fifteen years. The pursuit of
      my calling has not only led me all through England, but has taken me twice
      to Scotland, and once to Ireland. In moving from district to district, I
      am never guided beforehand by any settled plan. Sometimes the letters of
      recommendation which I get from persons who are satisfied with the work I
      have done for them determine the direction in which I travel. Sometimes I
      hear of a new neighborhood in which there is no resident artist of
      ability, and remove thither on speculation. Sometimes my friends among the
      picture-dealers say a good word on my behalf to their rich customers, and
      so pave the way for me in the large towns. Sometimes my prosperous and
      famous brother-artists, hearing of small commissions which it is not worth
      their while to accept, mention my name, and procure me introductions to
      pleasant country houses. Thus I get on, now in one way and now in another,
      not winning a reputation or making a fortune, but happier, perhaps, on the
      whole, than many men who have got both the one and the other. So, at
      least, I try to think now, though I started in my youth with as high an
      ambition as the best of them. Thank God, it is not my business here to
      speak of past times and their disappointments. A twinge of the old
      hopeless heartache comes over me sometimes still, when I think of my
      student days.
    </p>
    <p>
      One peculiarity of my present way of life is, that it brings me into
      contact with all sorts of characters. I almost feel, by this time, as if I
      had painted every civilized variety of the human race. Upon the whole, my
      experience of the world, rough as it has been, has not taught me to think
      unkindly of my fellow-creatures. I have certainly received such treatment
      at the hands of some of my sitters as I could not describe without
      saddening and shocking any kind-hearted reader; but, taking one year and
      one place with another, I have cause to remember with gratitude and
      respect&mdash;sometimes even with friendship and affection&mdash;a very
      large proportion of the numerous persons who have employed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the results of my experience are curious in a moral point of view.
      For example, I have found women almost uniformly less delicate in asking
      me about my terms, and less generous in remunerating me for my services,
      than men. On the other hand, men, within my knowledge, are decidedly
      vainer of their personal attractions, and more vexatiously anxious to have
      them done full justice to on canvas, than women. Taking both sexes
      together, I have found young people, for the most part, more gentle, more
      reasonable, and more considerate than old. And, summing up, in a general
      way, my experience of different ranks (which extends, let me premise, all
      the way down from peers to publicans), I have met with most of my formal
      and ungracious receptions among rich people of uncertain social standing:
      the highest classes and the lowest among my employers almost always
      contrive&mdash;in widely different ways, of course, to make me feel at
      home as soon as I enter their houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one great obstacle that I have to contend against in the practice of
      my profession is not, as some persons may imagine, the difficulty of
      making my sitters keep their heads still while I paint them, but the
      difficulty of getting them to preserve the natural look and the every-day
      peculiarities of dress and manner. People will assume an expression, will
      brush up their hair, will correct any little characteristic carelessness
      in their apparel&mdash;will, in short, when they want to have their
      likenesses taken, look as if they were sitting for their pictures. If I
      paint them, under these artificial circumstances, I fail of course to
      present them in their habitual aspect; and my portrait, as a necessary
      consequence, disappoints everybody, the sitter always included. When we
      wish to judge of a man&rsquo;s character by his handwriting, we want his
      customary scrawl dashed off with his common workaday pen, not his best
      small-text, traced laboriously with the finest procurable crow-quill
      point. So it is with portrait-painting, which is, after all, nothing but a
      right reading of the externals of character recognizably presented to the
      view of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experience, after repeated trials, has proved to me that the only way of
      getting sitters who persist in assuming a set look to resume their
      habitual expression, is to lead them into talking about some subject in
      which they are greatly interested. If I can only beguile them into
      speaking earnestly, no matter on what topic, I am sure of recovering their
      natural expression; sure of seeing all the little precious everyday
      peculiarities of the man or woman peep out, one after another, quite
      unawares. The long, maundering stories about nothing, the wearisome
      recitals of petty grievances, the local anecdotes unrelieved by the
      faintest suspicion of anything like general interest, which I have been
      condemned to hear, as a consequence of thawing the ice off the features of
      formal sitters by the method just described, would fill hundreds of
      volumes, and promote the repose of thousands of readers. On the other
      hand, if I have suffered under the tediousness of the many, I have not
      been without my compensating gains from the wisdom and experience of the
      few. To some of my sitters I have been indebted for information which has
      enlarged my mind&mdash;to some for advice which has lightened my heart&mdash;to
      some for narratives of strange adventure which riveted my attention at the
      time, which have served to interest and amuse my fireside circle for many
      years past, and which are now, I would fain hope, destined to make kind
      friends for me among a wider audience than any that I have yet addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Singularly enough, almost all the best stories that I have heard from my
      sitters have been told by accident. I only remember two cases in which a
      story was volunteered to me, and, although I have often tried the
      experiment, I cannot call to mind even a single instance in which leading
      questions (as the lawyers call them) on my part, addressed to a sitter,
      ever produced any result worth recording. Over and over again, I have been
      disastrously successful in encouraging dull people to weary me. But the
      clever people who have something interesting to say, seem, so far as I
      have observed them, to acknowledge no other stimulant than chance. For
      every story which I propose including in the present collection, excepting
      one, I have been indebted, in the first instance, to the capricious
      influence of the same chance. Something my sitter has seen about me,
      something I have remarked in my sitter, or in the room in which I take the
      likeness, or in the neighborhood through which I pass on my way to work,
      has suggested the necessary association, or has started the right train of
      recollections, and then the story appeared to begin of its own accord.
      Occasionally the most casual notice, on my part, of some very unpromising
      object has smoothed the way for the relation of a long and interesting
      narrative. I first heard one of the most dramatic of the stories that will
      be presented in this book, merely through being carelessly inquisitive to
      know the history of a stuffed poodle-dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thus not without reason that I lay some stress on the desirableness
      of prefacing each one of the following narratives by a brief account of
      the curious manner in which I became possessed of it. As to my capacity
      for repeating these stories correctly, I can answer for it that my memory
      may be trusted. I may claim it as a merit, because it is after all a
      mechanical one, that I forget nothing, and that I can call long-passed
      conversations and events as readily to my recollection as if they had
      happened but a few weeks ago. Of two things at least I feel tolerably
      certain beforehand, in meditating over the contents of this book: First,
      that I can repeat correctly all that I have heard; and, secondly, that I
      have never missed anything worth hearing when my sitters were addressing
      me on an interesting subject. Although I cannot take the lead in talking
      while I am engaged in painting, I can listen while others speak, and work
      all the better for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much in the way of general preface to the pages for which I am about to
      ask the reader&rsquo;s attention. Let me now advance to particulars, and
      describe how I came to hear the first story in the present collection. I
      begin with it because it is the story that I have oftenest &ldquo;rehearsed,&rdquo; to
      borrow a phrase from the stage. Wherever I go, I am sooner or later sure
      to tell it. Only last night, I was persuaded into repeating it once more
      by the inhabitants of the farmhouse in which I am now staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many years ago, on returning from a short holiday visit to a friend
      settled in Paris, I found professional letters awaiting me at my agent&rsquo;s
      in London, which required my immediate presence in Liverpool. Without
      stopping to unpack, I proceeded by the first conveyance to my new
      destination; and, calling at the picture-dealer&rsquo;s shop, where
      portrait-painting engagements were received for me, found to my great
      satisfaction that I had remunerative employment in prospect, in and about
      Liverpool, for at least two months to come. I was putting up my letters in
      high spirits, and was just leaving the picture-dealer&rsquo;s shop to look out
      for comfortable lodgings, when I was met at the door by the landlord of
      one of the largest hotels in Liverpool&mdash;an old acquaintance whom I
      had known as manager of a tavern in London in my student days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kerby!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in great astonishment. &ldquo;What an unexpected
      meeting! the last man in the world whom I expected to see, and yet the
      very man whose services I want to make use of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, more work for me?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;are all the people in Liverpool going
      to have their portraits painted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know of one,&rdquo; replied the landlord, &ldquo;a gentleman staying at my
      hotel, who wants a chalk drawing done for him. I was on my way here to
      inquire of any artist whom our picture-dealing friend could recommend. How
      glad I am that I met you before I had committed myself to employing a
      stranger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this likeness wanted at once?&rdquo; I asked, thinking of the number of
      engagements that I had already got in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately&mdash;to-day&mdash;this very hour, if possible,&rdquo; said the
      landlord. &ldquo;Mr. Faulkner, the gentleman I am speaking of, was to have
      sailed yesterday for the Brazils from this place; but the wind shifted
      last night to the wrong quarter, and he came ashore again this morning. He
      may of course be detained here for some time; but he may also be called on
      board ship at half an hour&rsquo;s notice, if the wind shifts back again in the
      right direction. This uncertainty makes it a matter of importance that the
      likeness should be begun immediately. Undertake it if you possibly can,
      for Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s a liberal gentleman, who is sure to give you your own
      terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I reflected for a minute or two. The portrait was only wanted in chalk,
      and would not take long; besides, I might finish it in the evening, if my
      other engagements pressed hard upon me in the daytime. Why not leave my
      luggage at the picture-dealer&rsquo;s, put off looking for lodgings till night,
      and secure the new commission boldly by going back at once with the
      landlord to the hotel? I decided on following this course almost as soon
      as the idea occurred to me&mdash;put my chalks in my pocket, and a sheet
      of drawing paper in the first of my portfolios that came to hand&mdash;and
      so presented myself before Mr. Faulkner, ready to take his likeness,
      literally at five minutes&rsquo; notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found him a very pleasant, intelligent man, young and handsome. He had
      been a great traveler; had visited all the wonders of the East; and was
      now about to explore the wilds of the vast South American Continent. Thus
      much he told me good-humoredly and unconstrainedly while I was preparing
      my drawing materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I had put him in the right light and position, and had seated
      myself opposite to him, he changed the subject of conversation, and asked
      me, a little confusedly as I thought, if it was not a customary practice
      among portrait-painters to gloss over the faults in their sitters&rsquo; faces,
      and to make as much as possible of any good points which their features
      might possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;You have described the whole art and mystery of
      successful portrait-painting in a few words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I beg, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you will depart from the usual practice
      in my case, and draw me with all my defects, exactly as I am? The fact
      is,&rdquo; he went on, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;the likeness you are now
      preparing to take is intended for my mother. My roving disposition makes
      me a great anxiety to her, and she parted from me this last time very
      sadly and unwillingly. I don&rsquo;t know how the idea came into my head, but it
      struck me this morning that I could not better employ the time, while I
      was delayed here on shore, than by getting my likeness done to send to her
      as a keepsake. She has no portrait of me since I was a child, and she is
      sure to value a drawing of me more than anything else I could send to her.
      I only trouble you with this explanation to prove that I am really sincere
      in my wish to be drawn unflatteringly, exactly as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Secretly respecting and admiring him for what he had just said, I promised
      that his directions should be implicitly followed, and began to work
      immediately. Before I had pursued my occupation for ten minutes, the
      conversation began to flag, and the usual obstacle to my success with a
      sitter gradually set itself up between us. Quite unconsciously, of course,
      Mr. Faulkner stiffened his neck, shut his month, and contracted his
      eyebrows&mdash;evidently under the impression that he was facilitating the
      process of taking his portrait by making his face as like a lifeless mask
      as possible. All traces of his natural animated expression were fast
      disappearing, and he was beginning to change into a heavy and rather
      melancholy-looking man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This complete alteration was of no great consequence so long as I was only
      engaged in drawing the outline of his face and the general form of his
      features. I accordingly worked on doggedly for more than an hour&mdash;then
      left off to point my chalks again, and to give my sitter a few minutes&rsquo;
      rest. Thus far the likeness had not suffered through Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s
      unfortunate notion of the right way of sitting for his portrait; but the
      time of difficulty, as I well knew, was to come. It was impossible for me
      to think of putting any expression into the drawing unless I could
      contrive some means, when he resumed his chair, of making him look like
      himself again. &ldquo;I will talk to him about foreign parts,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;and
      try if I can&rsquo;t make him forget that he is sitting for his picture in that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I was pointing my chalks Mr. Faulkner was walking up and down the
      room. He chanced to see the portfolio I had brought with me leaning
      against the wall, and asked if there were any sketches in it. I told him
      there were a few which I had made during my recent stay in Paris; &ldquo;In
      Paris?&rdquo; he repeated, with a look of interest; &ldquo;may I see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him the permission he asked as a matter of course. Sitting down, he
      took the portfolio on his knee, and began to look through it. He turned
      over the first five sketches rapidly enough; but when he came to the
      sixth, I saw his face flush directly, and observed that he took the
      drawing out of the portfolio, carried it to the window, and remained
      silently absorbed in the contemplation of it for full five minutes. After
      that, he turned round to me, and asked very anxiously if I had any
      objection to part with that sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the least interesting drawing of the collection&mdash;merely a view
      in one of the streets running by the backs of the houses in the Palais
      Royal. Some four or five of these houses were comprised in the view, which
      was of no particular use to me in any way; and which was too valueless, as
      a work of art, for me to think of selling it. I begged his acceptance of
      it at once. He thanked me quite warmly; and then, seeing that I looked a
      little surprised at the odd selection he had made from my sketches,
      laughingly asked me if I could guess why he had been so anxious to become
      possessed of the view which I had given him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;there is some remarkable historical association
      connected with that street at the back of the Palais Royal, of which I am
      ignorant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Faulkner; &ldquo;at least none that <i>I</i> know of. The only
      association connected with the place in <i>my</i> mind is a purely
      personal association. Look at this house in your drawing&mdash;the house
      with the water-pipe running down it from top to bottom. I once passed a
      night there&mdash;a night I shall never forget to the day of my death. I
      have had some awkward traveling adventures in my time; but <i>that</i>
      adventure&mdash;! Well, never mind, suppose we begin the sitting. I make
      but a bad return for your kindness in giving me the sketch by thus wasting
      your time in mere talk.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; thought I, as he went back to the sitter&rsquo;s chair, &ldquo;I shall
      see your natural expression on your face if I can only get you to talk
      about that adventure.&rdquo; It was easy enough to lead him in the right
      direction. At the first hint from me, he returned to the subject of the
      house in the back street. Without, I hope, showing any undue curiosity, I
      contrived to let him see that I felt a deep interest in everything he now
      said. After two or three preliminary hesitations, he at last, to my great
      joy, fairly started on the narrative of his adventure. In the interest of
      his subject he soon completely forgot that he was sitting for his portrait&mdash;the
      very expression that I wanted came over his face&mdash;and my drawing
      proceeded toward completion, in the right direction, and to the best
      purpose. At every fresh touch I felt more and more certain that I was now
      getting the better of my grand difficulty; and I enjoyed the additional
      gratification of having my work lightened by the recital of a true story,
      which possessed, in my estimation, all the excitement of the most exciting
      romance.

      This, as I recollect it, is how Mr. Faulkner told me his adventure:

    <h2>
      THE TRAVELER&rsquo;S STORY OF A TERRIBLY STRANGE BED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shortly after my education at college was finished, I happened to be
      staying at Paris with an English friend. We were both young men then, and
      lived, I am afraid, rather a wild life, in the delightful city of our
      sojourn. One night we were idling about the neighborhood of the Palais
      Royal, doubtful to what amusement we should next betake ourselves. My
      friend proposed a visit to Frascati&rsquo;s; but his suggestion was not to my
      taste. I knew Frascati&rsquo;s, as the French saying is, by heart; had lost and
      won plenty of five-franc pieces there, merely for amusement&rsquo;s sake, until
      it was amusement no longer, and was thoroughly tired, in fact, of all the
      ghastly respectabilities of such a social anomaly as a respectable
      gambling-house. &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said I to my friend, &ldquo;let us go
      somewhere where we can see a little genuine, blackguard, poverty-stricken
      gaming with no false gingerbread glitter thrown over it all. Let us get
      away from fashionable Frascati&rsquo;s, to a house where they don&rsquo;t mind letting
      in a man with a ragged coat, or a man with no coat, ragged or otherwise.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;we needn&rsquo;t go out of the Palais Royal to
      find the sort of company you want. Here&rsquo;s the place just before us; as
      blackguard a place, by all report, as you could possibly wish to see.&rdquo; In
      another minute we arrived at the door, and entered the house, the back of
      which you have drawn in your sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got upstairs, and had left our hats and sticks with the
      doorkeeper, we were admitted into the chief gambling-room. We did not find
      many people assembled there. But, few as the men were who looked up at us
      on our entrance, they were all types&mdash;lamentably true types&mdash;of
      their respective classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had come to see blackguards; but these men were something worse. There
      is a comic side, more or less appreciable, in all blackguardism&mdash;here
      there was nothing but tragedy&mdash;mute, weird tragedy. The quiet in the
      room was horrible. The thin, haggard, long-haired young man, whose sunken
      eyes fiercely watched the turning up of the cards, never spoke; the
      flabby, fat-faced, pimply player, who pricked his piece of pasteboard
      perseveringly, to register how often black won, and how often red&mdash;never
      spoke; the dirty, wrinkled old man, with the vulture eyes and the darned
      great-coat, who had lost his last <i>sou,</i> and still looked on
      desperately, after he could play no longer&mdash;never spoke. Even the
      voice of the croupier sounded as if it were strangely dulled and thickened
      in the atmosphere of the room. I had entered the place to laugh, but the
      spectacle before me was something to weep over. I soon found it necessary
      to take refuge in excitement from the depression of spirits which was fast
      stealing on me. Unfortunately I sought the nearest excitement, by going to
      the table and beginning to play. Still more unfortunately, as the event
      will show, I won&mdash;won prodigiously; won incredibly; won at such a
      rate that the regular players at the table crowded round me; and staring
      at my stakes with hungry, superstitious eyes, whispered to one another
      that the English stranger was going to break the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game was <i>Rouge et Noir</i>. I had played at it in every city in
      Europe, without, however, the care or the wish to study the Theory of
      Chances&mdash;that philosopher&rsquo;s stone of all gamblers! And a gambler, in
      the strict sense of the word, I had never been. I was heart-whole from the
      corroding passion for play. My gaming was a mere idle amusement. I never
      resorted to it by necessity, because I never knew what it was to want
      money. I never practiced it so incessantly as to lose more than I could
      afford, or to gain more than I could coolly pocket without being thrown
      off my balance by my good luck. In short, I had hitherto frequented
      gambling-tables&mdash;just as I frequented ball-rooms and opera-houses&mdash;because
      they amused me, and because I had nothing better to do with my leisure
      hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this occasion it was very different&mdash;now, for the first time
      in my life, I felt what the passion for play really was. My success first
      bewildered, and then, in the most literal meaning of the word, intoxicated
      me. Incredible as it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that I only lost
      when I attempted to estimate chances, and played according to previous
      calculation. If I left everything to luck, and staked without any care or
      consideration, I was sure to win&mdash;to win in the face of every
      recognized probability in favor of the bank. At first some of the men
      present ventured their money safely enough on my color; but I speedily
      increased my stakes to sums which they dared not risk. One after another
      they left off playing, and breathlessly looked on at my game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, time after time, I staked higher and higher, and still won. The
      excitement in the room rose to fever pitch. The silence was interrupted by
      a deep-muttered chorus of oaths and exclamations in different languages,
      every time the gold was shoveled across to my side of the table&mdash;even
      the imperturbable croupier dashed his rake on the floor in a (French) fury
      of astonishment at my success. But one man present preserved his
      self-possession, and that man was my friend. He came to my side, and
      whispering in English, begged me to leave the place, satisfied with what I
      had already gained. I must do him the justice to say that he repeated his
      warnings and entreaties several times, and only left me and went away
      after I had rejected his advice (I was to all intents and purposes
      gambling drunk) in terms which rendered it impossible for him to address
      me again that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after he had gone, a hoarse voice behind me cried: &ldquo;Permit me, my
      dear sir&mdash;permit me to restore to their proper place two napoleons
      which you have dropped. Wonderful luck, sir! I pledge you my word of
      honor, as an old soldier, in the course of my long experience in this sort
      of thing, I never saw such luck as yours&mdash;never! Go on, sir&mdash;<i>Sacre
      mille bombes!</i> Go on boldly, and break the bank!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned round and saw, nodding and smiling at me with inveterate
      civility, a tall man, dressed in a frogged and braided surtout.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had been in my senses, I should have considered him, personally, as
      being rather a suspicious specimen of an old soldier. He had goggling,
      bloodshot eyes, mangy mustaches, and a broken nose. His voice betrayed a
      barrack-room intonation of the worst order, and he had the dirtiest pair
      of hands I ever saw&mdash;even in France. These little personal
      peculiarities exercised, however, no repelling influence on me. In the mad
      excitement, the reckless triumph of that moment, I was ready to
      &ldquo;fraternize&rdquo; with anybody who encouraged me in my game. I accepted the old
      soldier&rsquo;s offered pinch of snuff; clapped him on the back, and swore he
      was the honestest fellow in the world&mdash;the most glorious relic of the
      Grand Army that I had ever met with. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; cried my military friend,
      snapping his fingers in ecstasy&mdash;&ldquo;Go on, and win! Break the bank&mdash;<i>Mille
      tonnerres!</i> my gallant English comrade, break the bank!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I <i>did</i> go on&mdash;went on at such a rate, that in another
      quarter of an hour the croupier called out, &ldquo;Gentlemen, the bank has
      discontinued for to-night.&rdquo; All the notes, and all the gold in that
      &ldquo;bank,&rdquo; now lay in a heap under my hands; the whole floating capital of
      the gambling-house was waiting to pour into my pockets!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie up the money in your pocket-handkerchief, my worthy sir,&rdquo; said the
      old soldier, as I wildly plunged my hands into my heap of gold. &ldquo;Tie it
      up, as we used to tie up a bit of dinner in the Grand Army; your winnings
      are too heavy for any breeches-pockets that ever were sewed. There! that&rsquo;s
      it&mdash;shovel them in, notes and all! <i>Credie!</i> what luck! Stop!
      another napoleon on the floor! <i>Ah! sacre petit polisson de Napoleon!</i>
      have I found thee at last? Now then, sir&mdash;two tight double knots each
      way with your honorable permission, and the money&rsquo;s safe. Feel it! feel
      it, fortunate sir! hard and round as a cannon-ball&mdash;<i>Ah, bah!</i>
      if they had only fired such cannon-balls at us at Austerlitz&mdash;<i>nom
      d&rsquo;une pipe!</i> if they only had! And now, as an ancient grenadier, as an
      ex-brave of the French army, what remains for me to do? I ask what? Simply
      this: to entreat my valued English friend to drink a bottle of Champagne
      with me, and toast the goddess Fortune in foaming goblets before we part!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Excellent ex-brave! Convivial ancient grenadier! Champagne by all means!
      An English cheer for an old soldier! Hurrah! hurrah! Another English cheer
      for the goddess Fortune! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! the Englishman; the amiable, gracious Englishman, in whose veins
      circulates the vivacious blood of France! Another glass? <i>Ah, bah!</i>&mdash;the
      bottle is empty! Never mind! <i>Vive le vin!</i> I, the old soldier, order
      another bottle, and half a pound of bonbons with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, ex-brave; never&mdash;ancient grenadier! <i>Your</i> bottle last
      time; <i>my</i> bottle this. Behold it! Toast away! The French Army! the
      great Napoleon! the present company! the croupier! the honest croupier&rsquo;s
      wife and daughters&mdash;if he has any! the Ladies generally! everybody in
      the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time the second bottle of Champagne was emptied, I felt as if I had
      been drinking liquid fire&mdash;my brain seemed all aflame. No excess in
      wine had ever had this effect on me before in my life. Was it the result
      of a stimulant acting upon my system when I was in a highly excited state?
      Was my stomach in a particularly disordered condition? Or was the
      Champagne amazingly strong?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ex-brave of the French Army!&rdquo; cried I, in a mad state of exhilaration, &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      am on fire! how are <i>you?</i> You have set me on fire! Do you hear, my
      hero of Austerlitz? Let us have a third bottle of Champagne to put the
      flame out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old soldier wagged his head, rolled his goggle-eyes, until I expected
      to see them slip out of their sockets; placed his dirty forefinger by the
      side of his broken nose; solemnly ejaculated &ldquo;Coffee!&rdquo; and immediately ran
      off into an inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word pronounced by the eccentric veteran seemed to have a magical
      effect on the rest of the company present. With one accord they all rose
      to depart. Probably they had expected to profit by my intoxication; but
      finding that my new friend was benevolently bent on preventing me from
      getting dead drunk, had now abandoned all hope of thriving pleasantly on
      my winnings. Whatever their motive might be, at any rate they went away in
      a body. When the old soldier returned, and sat down again opposite to me
      at the table, we had the room to ourselves. I could see the croupier, in a
      sort of vestibule which opened out of it, eating his supper in solitude.
      The silence was now deeper than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden change, too, had come over the &ldquo;ex-brave.&rdquo; He assumed a
      portentously solemn look; and when he spoke to me again, his speech was
      ornamented by no oaths, enforced by no finger-snapping, enlivened by no
      apostrophes or exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, my dear sir,&rdquo; said he, in mysteriously confidential tones&mdash;&ldquo;listen
      to an old soldier&rsquo;s advice. I have been to the mistress of the house (a
      very charming woman, with a genius for cookery!) to impress on her the
      necessity of making us some particularly strong and good coffee. You must
      drink this coffee in order to get rid of your little amiable exaltation of
      spirits before you think of going home&mdash;you <i>must,</i> my good and
      gracious friend! With all that money to take home to-night, it is a sacred
      duty to yourself to have your wits about you. You are known to be a winner
      to an enormous extent by several gentlemen present to-night, who, in a
      certain point of view, are very worthy and excellent fellows; but they are
      mortal men, my dear sir, and they have their amiable weaknesses. Need I
      say more? Ah, no, no! you understand me! Now, this is what you must do&mdash;send
      for a cabriolet when you feel quite well again&mdash;draw up all the
      windows when you get into it&mdash;and tell the driver to take you home
      only through the large and well-lighted thoroughfares. Do this; and you
      and your money will be safe. Do this; and to-morrow you will thank an old
      soldier for giving you a word of honest advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as the ex-brave ended his oration in very lachrymose tones, the
      coffee came in, ready poured out in two cups. My attentive friend handed
      me one of the cups with a bow. I was parched with thirst, and drank it off
      at a draught. Almost instantly afterwards, I was seized with a fit of
      giddiness, and felt more completely intoxicated than ever. The room
      whirled round and round furiously; the old soldier seemed to be regularly
      bobbing up and down before me like the piston of a steam-engine. I was
      half deafened by a violent singing in my ears; a feeling of utter
      bewilderment, helplessness, idiocy, overcame me. I rose from my chair,
      holding on by the table to keep my balance; and stammered out that I felt
      dreadfully unwell&mdash;so unwell that I did not know how I was to get
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; answered the old soldier&mdash;and even his voice seemed
      to be bobbing up and down as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;my dear friend, it would be
      madness to go home in <i>your</i> state; you would be sure to lose your
      money; you might be robbed and murdered with the greatest ease. <i>I</i>
      am going to sleep here; do <i>you</i> sleep here, too&mdash;they make up
      capital beds in this house&mdash;take one; sleep off the effects of the
      wine, and go home safely with your winnings to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow, in
      broad daylight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had but two ideas left: one, that I must never let go hold of my
      handkerchief full of money; the other, that I must lie down somewhere
      immediately, and fall off into a comfortable sleep. So I agreed to the
      proposal about the bed, and took the offered arm of the old soldier,
      carrying my money with my disengaged hand. Preceded by the croupier, we
      passed along some passages and up a flight of stairs into the bedroom
      which I was to occupy. The ex-brave shook me warmly by the hand, proposed
      that we should breakfast together, and then, followed by the croupier,
      left me for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran to the wash-hand stand; drank some of the water in my jug; poured
      the rest out, and plunged my face into it; then sat down in a chair and
      tried to compose myself. I soon felt better. The change for my lungs, from
      the fetid atmosphere of the gambling-room to the cool air of the apartment
      I now occupied, the almost equally refreshing change for my eyes, from the
      glaring gaslights of the &ldquo;salon&rdquo; to the dim, quiet flicker of one
      bedroom-candle, aided wonderfully the restorative effects of cold water.
      The giddiness left me, and I began to feel a little like a reasonable
      being again. My first thought was of the risk of sleeping all night in a
      gambling-house; my second, of the still greater risk of trying to get out
      after the house was closed, and of going home alone at night through the
      streets of Paris with a large sum of money about me. I had slept in worse
      places than this on my travels; so I determined to lock, bolt, and
      barricade my door, and take my chance till the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, I secured myself against all intrusion; looked under the bed,
      and into the cupboard; tried the fastening of the window; and then,
      satisfied that I had taken every proper precaution, pulled off my upper
      clothing, put my light, which was a dim one, on the hearth among a
      feathery litter of wood-ashes, and got into bed, with the handkerchief
      full of money under my pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon felt not only that I could not go to sleep, but that I could not
      even close my eyes. I was wide awake, and in a high fever. Every nerve in
      my body trembled&mdash;every one of my senses seemed to be preternaturally
      sharpened. I tossed and rolled, and tried every kind of position, and
      perseveringly sought out the cold corners of the bed, and all to no
      purpose. Now I thrust my arms over the clothes; now I poked them under the
      clothes; now I violently shot my legs straight out down to the bottom of
      the bed; now I convulsively coiled them up as near my chin as they would
      go; now I shook out my crumpled pillow, changed it to the cool side,
      patted it flat, and lay down quietly on my back; now I fiercely doubled it
      in two, set it up on end, thrust it against the board of the bed, and
      tried a sitting posture. Every effort was in vain; I groaned with vexation
      as I felt that I was in for a sleepless night.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could I do? I had no book to read. And yet, unless I found out some
      method of diverting my mind, I felt certain that I was in the condition to
      imagine all sorts of horrors; to rack my brain with forebodings of every
      possible and impossible danger; in short, to pass the night in suffering
      all conceivable varieties of nervous terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised myself on my elbow, and looked about the room&mdash;which was
      brightened by a lovely moonlight pouring straight through the window&mdash;to
      see if it contained any pictures or ornaments that I could at all clearly
      distinguish. While my eyes wandered from wall to wall, a remembrance of Le
      Maistre&rsquo;s delightful little book, &ldquo;Voyage autour de ma Chambre,&rdquo; occurred
      to me. I resolved to imitate the French author, and find occupation and
      amusement enough to relieve the tedium of my wakefulness, by making a
      mental inventory of every article of furniture I could see, and by
      following up to their sources the multitude of associations which even a
      chair, a table, or a wash-hand stand may be made to call forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the nervous unsettled state of my mind at that moment, I found it much
      easier to make my inventory than to make my reflections, and thereupon
      soon gave up all hope of thinking in Le Maistre&rsquo;s fanciful track&mdash;or,
      indeed, of thinking at all. I looked about the room at the different
      articles of furniture, and did nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, first, the bed I was lying in; a four-post bed, of all things
      in the world to meet with in Paris&mdash;yes, a thorough clumsy British
      four-poster, with the regular top lined with chintz&mdash;the regular
      fringed valance all round&mdash;the regular stifling, unwholesome
      curtains, which I remembered having mechanically drawn back against the
      posts without particularly noticing the bed when I first got into the
      room. Then there was the marble-topped wash-hand stand, from which the
      water I had spilled, in my hurry to pour it out, was still dripping,
      slowly and more slowly, on to the brick floor. Then two small chairs, with
      my coat, waistcoat, and trousers flung on them. Then a large elbow-chair
      covered with dirty-white dimity, with my cravat and shirt collar thrown
      over the back. Then a chest of drawers with two of the brass handles off,
      and a tawdry, broken china inkstand placed on it by way of ornament for
      the top. Then the dressing-table, adorned by a very small looking-glass,
      and a very large pincushion. Then the window&mdash;an unusually large
      window. Then a dark old picture, which the feeble candle dimly showed me.
      It was a picture of a fellow in a high Spanish hat, crowned with a plume
      of towering feathers. A swarthy, sinister ruffian, looking upward, shading
      his eyes with his hand, and looking intently upward&mdash;it might be at
      some tall gallows at which he was going to be hanged. At any rate, he had
      the appearance of thoroughly deserving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This picture put a kind of constraint upon me to look upward too&mdash;at
      the top of the bed. It was a gloomy and not an interesting object, and I
      looked back at the picture. I counted the feathers in the man&rsquo;s hat&mdash;they
      stood out in relief&mdash;three white, two green. I observed the crown of
      his hat, which was of conical shape, according to the fashion supposed to
      have been favored by Guido Fawkes. I wondered what he was looking up at.
      It couldn&rsquo;t be at the stars; such a desperado was neither astrologer nor
      astronomer. It must be at the high gallows, and he was going to be hanged
      presently. Would the executioner come into possession of his conical
      crowned hat and plume of feathers? I counted the feathers again&mdash;three
      white, two green.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I still lingered over this very improving and intellectual
      employment, my thoughts insensibly began to wander. The moonlight shining
      into the room reminded me of a certain moonlight night in England&mdash;the
      night after a picnic party in a Welsh valley. Every incident of the drive
      homeward, through lovely scenery, which the moonlight made lovelier than
      ever, came back to my remembrance, though I had never given the picnic a
      thought for years; though, if I had <i>tried</i> to recollect it, I could
      certainly have recalled little or nothing of that scene long past. Of all
      the wonderful faculties that help to tell us we are immortal, which speaks
      the sublime truth more eloquently than memory? Here was I, in a strange
      house of the most suspicious character, in a situation of uncertainty, and
      even of peril, which might seem to make the cool exercise of my
      recollection almost out of the question; nevertheless, remembering, quite
      involuntarily, places, people, conversations, minute circumstances of
      every kind, which I had thought forgotten forever; which I could not
      possibly have recalled at will, even under the most favorable auspices.
      And what cause had produced in a moment the whole of this strange,
      complicated, mysterious effect? Nothing but some rays of moonlight shining
      in at my bedroom window.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still thinking of the picnic&mdash;of our merriment on the drive
      home&mdash;of the sentimental young lady who <i>would</i> quote &ldquo;Childe
      Harold&rdquo; because it was moonlight. I was absorbed by these past scenes and
      past amusements, when, in an instant, the thread on which my memories hung
      snapped asunder; my attention immediately came back to present things more
      vividly than ever, and I found myself, I neither knew why nor wherefore,
      looking hard at the picture again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking for what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Good God! the man had pulled his hat down on his brows! No! the hat itself
      was gone! Where was the conical crown? Where the feathers&mdash;three
      white, two green? Not there! In place of the hat and feathers, what dusky
      object was it that now hid his forehead, his eyes, his shading hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the bed moving?
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned on my back and looked up. Was I mad? drunk? dreaming? giddy
      again? or was the top of the bed really moving down&mdash;sinking slowly,
      regularly, silently, horribly, right down throughout the whole of its
      length and breadth&mdash;right down upon me, as I lay underneath?
    </p>
    <p>
      My blood seemed to stand still. A deadly paralysing coldness stole all
      over me as I turned my head round on the pillow and determined to test
      whether the bed-top was really moving or not, by keeping my eye on the man
      in the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next look in that direction was enough. The dull, black, frowzy
      outline of the valance above me was within an inch of being parallel with
      his waist. I still looked breathlessly. And steadily and slowly&mdash;very
      slowly&mdash;I saw the figure, and the line of frame below the figure,
      vanish, as the valance moved down before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am, constitutionally, anything but timid. I have been on more than one
      occasion in peril of my life, and have not lost my self-possession for an
      instant; but when the conviction first settled on my mind that the bed-top
      was really moving, was steadily and continuously sinking down upon me, I
      looked up shuddering, helpless, panic-stricken, beneath the hideous
      machinery for murder, which was advancing closer and closer to suffocate
      me where I lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up, motionless, speechless, breathless. The candle, fully spent,
      went out; but the moonlight still brightened the room. Down and down,
      without pausing and without sounding, came the bed-top, and still my
      panic-terror seemed to bind me faster and faster to the mattress on which
      I lay&mdash;down and down it sank, till the dusty odor from the lining of
      the canopy came stealing into my nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that final moment the instinct of self-preservation startled me out of
      my trance, and I moved at last. There was just room for me to roll myself
      sidewise off the bed. As I dropped noiselessly to the floor, the edge of
      the murderous canopy touched me on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without stopping to draw my breath, without wiping the cold sweat from my
      face, I rose instantly on my knees to watch the bed-top. I was literally
      spellbound by it. If I had heard footsteps behind me, I could not have
      turned round; if a means of escape had been miraculously provided for me,
      I could not have moved to take advantage of it. The whole life in me was,
      at that moment, concentrated in my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It descended&mdash;the whole canopy, with the fringe round it, came down&mdash;down&mdash;close
      down; so close that there was not room now to squeeze my finger between
      the bed-top and the bed. I felt at the sides, and discovered that what had
      appeared to me from beneath to be the ordinary light canopy of a four-post
      bed was in reality a thick, broad mattress, the substance of which was
      concealed by the valance and its fringe. I looked up and saw the four
      posts rising hideously bare. In the middle of the bed-top was a huge
      wooden screw that had evidently worked it down through a hole in the
      ceiling, just as ordinary presses are worked down on the substance
      selected for compression. The frightful apparatus moved without making the
      faintest noise. There had been no creaking as it came down; there was now
      not the faintest sound from the room above. Amid a dead and awful silence
      I beheld before me&mdash;in the nineteenth century, and in the civilized
      capital of France&mdash;such a machine for secret murder by suffocation as
      might have existed in the worst days of the Inquisition, in the lonely
      inns among the Hartz Mountains, in the mysterious tribunals of Westphalia!
      Still, as I looked on it, I could not move, I could hardly breathe, but I
      began to recover the power of thinking, and in a moment I discovered the
      murderous conspiracy framed against me in all its horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      My cup of coffee had been drugged, and drugged too strongly. I had been
      saved from being smothered by having taken an overdose of some narcotic.
      How I had chafed and fretted at the fever fit which had preserved my life
      by keeping me awake! How recklessly I had confided myself to the two
      wretches who had led me into this room, determined, for the sake of my
      winnings, to kill me in my sleep by the surest and most horrible
      contrivance for secretly accomplishing my destruction! How many men,
      winners like me, had slept, as I had proposed to sleep, in that bed, and
      had never been seen or heard of more! I shuddered at the bare idea of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, ere long, all thought was again suspended by the sight of the
      murderous canopy moving once more. After it had remained on the bed&mdash;as
      nearly as I could guess&mdash;about ten minutes, it began to move up
      again. The villains who worked it from above evidently believed that their
      purpose was now accomplished. Slowly and silently, as it had descended,
      that horrible bed-top rose towards its former place. When it reached the
      upper extremities of the four posts, it reached the ceiling, too. Neither
      hole nor screw could be seen; the bed became in appearance an ordinary bed
      again&mdash;the canopy an ordinary canopy&mdash;even to the most
      suspicious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the first time, I was able to move&mdash;to rise from my knees&mdash;to
      dress myself in my upper clothing&mdash;and to consider of how I should
      escape. If I betrayed by the smallest noise that the attempt to suffocate
      me had failed, I was certain to be murdered. Had I made any noise already?
      I listened intently, looking towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! no footsteps in the passage outside&mdash;no sound of a tread, light
      or heavy, in the room above&mdash;absolute silence everywhere. Besides
      locking and bolting my door, I had moved an old wooden chest against it,
      which I had found under the bed. To remove this chest (my blood ran cold
      as I thought of what its contents <i>might</i> be!) without making some
      disturbance was impossible; and, moreover, to think of escaping through
      the house, now barred up for the night, was sheer insanity. Only one
      chance was left me&mdash;the window. I stole to it on tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      My bedroom was on the first floor, above an <i>entresol,</i> and looked
      into a back street, which you have sketched in your view. I raised my hand
      to open the window, knowing that on that action hung, by the merest
      hair-breadth, my chance of safety. They keep vigilant watch in a House of
      Murder. If any part of the frame cracked, if the hinge creaked, I was a
      lost man! It must have occupied me at least five minutes, reckoning by
      time&mdash;five <i>hours,</i> reckoning by suspense&mdash;to open that
      window. I succeeded in doing it silently&mdash;in doing it with all the
      dexterity of a house-breaker&mdash;and then looked down into the street.
      To leap the distance beneath me would be almost certain destruction! Next,
      I looked round at the sides of the house. Down the left side ran a thick
      water-pipe which you have drawn&mdash;it passed close by the outer edge of
      the window. The moment I saw the pipe I knew I was saved. My breath came
      and went freely for the first time since I had seen the canopy of the bed
      moving down upon me!
    </p>
    <p>
      To some men the means of escape which I had discovered might have seemed
      difficult and dangerous enough&mdash;to <i>me</i> the prospect of slipping
      down the pipe into the street did not suggest even a thought of peril. I
      had always been accustomed, by the practice of gymnastics, to keep up my
      school-boy powers as a daring and expert climber; and knew that my head,
      hands, and feet would serve me faithfully in any hazards of ascent or
      descent. I had already got one leg over the window-sill, when I remembered
      the handkerchief filled with money under my pillow. I could well have
      afforded to leave it behind me, but I was revengefully determined that the
      miscreants of the gambling-house should miss their plunder as well as
      their victim. So I went back to the bed and tied the heavy handkerchief at
      my back by my cravat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I had made it tight and fixed it in a comfortable place, I thought
      I heard a sound of breathing outside the door. The chill feeling of horror
      ran through me again as I listened. No! dead silence still in the passage&mdash;I
      had only heard the night air blowing softly into the room. The next moment
      I was on the window-sill&mdash;and the next I had a firm grip on the
      water-pipe with my hands and knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slid down into the street easily and quietly, as I thought I should, and
      immediately set off at the top of my speed to a branch &ldquo;Prefecture&rdquo; of
      Police, which I knew was situated in the immediate neighborhood. A
      &ldquo;Sub-prefect,&rdquo; and several picked men among his subordinates, happened to
      be up, maturing, I believe, some scheme for discovering the perpetrator of
      a mysterious murder which all Paris was talking of just then. When I began
      my story, in a breathless hurry and in very bad French, I could see that
      the Sub-prefect suspected me of being a drunken Englishman who had robbed
      somebody; but he soon altered his opinion as I went on, and before I had
      anything like concluded, he shoved all the papers before him into a
      drawer, put on his hat, supplied me with another (for I was bareheaded),
      ordered a file of soldiers, desired his expert followers to get ready all
      sorts of tools for breaking open doors and ripping up brick flooring, and
      took my arm, in the most friendly and familiar manner possible, to lead me
      with him out of the house. I will venture to say that when the Sub-prefect
      was a little boy, and was taken for the first time to the play, he was not
      half as much pleased as he was now at the job in prospect for him at the
      gambling-house!
    </p>
    <p>
      Away we went through the streets, the Sub-prefect cross-examining and
      congratulating me in the same breath as we marched at the head of our
      formidable <i>posse comitatus.</i> Sentinels were placed at the back and
      front of the house the moment we got to it; a tremendous battery of knocks
      was directed against the door; a light appeared at a window; I was told to
      conceal myself behind the police&mdash;then came more knocks and a cry of
      &ldquo;Open in the name of the law!&rdquo; At that terrible summons bolts and locks
      gave way before an invisible hand, and the moment after the Sub-prefect
      was in the passage, confronting a waiter half-dressed and ghastly pale.
      This was the short dialogue which immediately took place:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to see the Englishman who is sleeping in this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went away hours ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did no such thing. His friend went away; <i>he</i> remained. Show us
      to his bedroom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you, Monsieur le Sous-prefect, he is not here! he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you, Monsieur le Garcon, he is. He slept here&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t
      find your bed comfortable&mdash;he came to us to complain of it&mdash;here
      he is among my men&mdash;and here am I ready to look for a flea or two in
      his bedstead. Renaudin! (calling to one of the subordinates, and pointing
      to the waiter) collar that man and tie his hands behind him. Now, then,
      gentlemen, let us walk upstairs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every man and woman in the house was secured&mdash;the &ldquo;Old Soldier&rdquo; the
      first. Then I identified the bed in which I had slept, and then we went
      into the room above.
    </p>
    <p>
      No object that was at all extraordinary appeared in any part of it. The
      Sub-prefect looked round the place, commanded everybody to be silent,
      stamped twice on the floor, called for a candle, looked attentively at the
      spot he had stamped on, and ordered the flooring there to be carefully
      taken up. This was done in no time. Lights were produced, and we saw a
      deep raftered cavity between the floor of this room and the ceiling of the
      room beneath. Through this cavity there ran perpendicularly a sort of case
      of iron thickly greased; and inside the case appeared the screw, which
      communicated with the bed-top below. Extra lengths of screw, freshly
      oiled; levers covered with felt; all the complete upper works of a heavy
      press&mdash;constructed with infernal ingenuity so as to join the fixtures
      below, and when taken to pieces again, to go into the smallest possible
      compass&mdash;were next discovered and pulled out on the floor. After some
      little difficulty the Sub-prefect succeeded in putting the machinery
      together, and, leaving his men to work it, descended with me to the
      bedroom. The smothering canopy was then lowered, but not so noiselessly as
      I had seen it lowered. When I mentioned this to the Sub-prefect, his
      answer, simple as it was, had a terrible significance. &ldquo;My men,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;are working down the bed-top for the first time&mdash;the men whose money
      you won were in better practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We left the house in the sole possession of two police agents&mdash;every
      one of the inmates being removed to prison on the spot. The Sub-prefect,
      after taking down my <i>&ldquo;proces verbal&rdquo;</i> in his office, returned with
      me to my hotel to get my passport. &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; I asked, as I gave it
      to him, &ldquo;that any men have really been smothered in that bed, as they
      tried to smother <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen dozens of drowned men laid out at the Morgue,&rdquo; answered the
      Sub-prefect, &ldquo;in whose pocket-books were found letters stating that they
      had committed suicide in the Seine, because they had lost everything at
      the gaming table. Do I know how many of those men entered the same
      gambling-house that <i>you</i> entered? won as <i>you</i> won? took that
      bed as <i>you</i> took it? slept in it? were smothered in it? and were
      privately thrown into the river, with a letter of explanation written by
      the murderers and placed in their pocket-books? No man can say how many or
      how few have suffered the fate from which you have escaped. The people of
      the gambling-house kept their bedstead machinery a secret from <i>us</i>&mdash;even
      from the police! The dead kept the rest of the secret for them.
      Good-night, or rather good-morning, Monsieur Faulkner! Be at my office
      again at nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;in the meantime, <i>au revoir!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of my story is soon told. I was examined and re-examined; the
      gambling-house was strictly searched all through from top to bottom; the
      prisoners were separately interrogated; and two of the less guilty among
      them made a confession. I discovered that the Old Soldier was the master
      of the gambling-house&mdash;<i>justice</i> discovered that he had been
      drummed out of the army as a vagabond years ago; that he had been guilty
      of all sorts of villainies since; that he was in possession of stolen
      property, which the owners identified; and that he, the croupier, another
      accomplice, and the woman who had made my cup of coffee, were all in the
      secret of the bedstead. There appeared some reason to doubt whether the
      inferior persons attached to the house knew anything of the suffocating
      machinery; and they received the benefit of that doubt, by being treated
      simply as thieves and vagabonds. As for the Old Soldier and his two head
      myrmidons, they went to the galleys; the woman who had drugged my coffee
      was imprisoned for I forget how many years; the regular attendants at the
      gambling-house were considered &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; and placed under
      &ldquo;surveillance&rdquo;; and I became, for one whole week (which is a long time)
      the head &ldquo;lion&rdquo; in Parisian society. My adventure was dramatized by three
      illustrious play-makers, but never saw theatrical daylight; for the
      censorship forbade the introduction on the stage of a correct copy of the
      gambling-house bedstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      One good result was produced by my adventure, which any censorship must
      have approved: it cured me of ever again trying <i>&ldquo;Rouge et Noir&rdquo;</i> as
      an amusement. The sight of a green cloth, with packs of cards and heaps of
      money on it, will henceforth be forever associated in my mind with the
      sight of a bed canopy descending to suffocate me in the silence and
      darkness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Mr. Faulkner pronounced these words he started in his chair, and
      resumed his stiff, dignified position in a great hurry. &ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo;
       cried he, with a comic look of astonishment and vexation, &ldquo;while I have
      been telling you what is the real secret of my interest in the sketch you
      have so kindly given to me, I have altogether forgotten that I came here
      to sit for my portrait. For the last hour or more I must have been the
      worst model you ever had to draw from!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, you have been the best,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I have been trying to
      catch your likeness; and, while telling your story, you have unconsciously
      shown me the natural expression I wanted to insure my success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      NOTE BY MRS. KERBY.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot let this story end without mentioning what the chance saying was
      which caused it to be told at the farmhouse the other night. Our friend
      the young sailor, among his other quaint objections to sleeping on shore,
      declared that he particularly hated four-post beds, because he never slept
      in one without doubting whether the top might not come down in the night
      and suffocate him. I thought this chance reference to the distinguishing
      feature of William&rsquo;s narrative curious enough, and my husband agreed with
      me. But he says it is scarcely worth while to mention such a trifle in
      anything so important as a book. I cannot venture, after this, to do more
      than slip these lines in modestly at the end of the story. If the printer
      should notice my few last words, perhaps he may not mind the trouble of
      putting them into some out-of-the-way corner.

    <h2>
      PROLOGUE TO THE SECOND STORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The beginning of an excellent connection which I succeeded in establishing
      in and around that respectable watering-place, Tidbury-on-the-Marsh, was
      an order for a life-size oil portrait of a great local celebrity&mdash;one
      Mr. Boxsious, a solicitor, who was understood to do the most thriving
      business of any lawyer in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait was intended as a testimonial &ldquo;expressive (to use the
      language of the circular forwarded to me at the time) of the eminent
      services of Mr. Boxsious in promoting and securing the prosperity of the
      town.&rdquo; It had been subscribed for by the &ldquo;Municipal Authorities and
      Resident Inhabitants&rdquo; of Tidbury-on-the-Marsh; and it was to be presented,
      when done, to Mrs. Boxsious, &ldquo;as a slight but sincere token&rdquo;&mdash;and so
      forth. A timely recommendation from one of my kindest friends and patrons
      placed the commission for painting the likeness in my lucky hands; and I
      was instructed to attend on a certain day at Mr. Boxsious&rsquo;s private
      residence, with all my materials ready for taking a first sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the house, I was shown into a very prettily furnished
      morning-room. The bow-window looked out on a large inclosed meadow, which
      represented the principal square in Tidbury. On the opposite side of the
      meadow I could see the new hotel (with a wing lately added), and close by,
      the old hotel obstinately unchanged since it had first been built. Then,
      further down the street, the doctor&rsquo;s house, with a colored lamp and a
      small door-plate, and the banker&rsquo;s office, with a plain lamp and a big
      door-plate&mdash;then some dreary private lodging-houses&mdash;then, at
      right angles to these, a street of shops; the cheese-monger&rsquo;s very small,
      the chemist&rsquo;s very smart, the pastry-cook&rsquo;s very dowdy, and the
      green-grocer&rsquo;s very dark, I was still looking out at the view thus
      presented, when I was suddenly apostrophized by a glib, disputatious voice
      behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, Mr. Artist,&rdquo; cried the voice, &ldquo;do you call that getting ready
      for work? Where are your paints and brushes, and all the rest of it? My
      name&rsquo;s Boxsious, and I&rsquo;m here to sit for my picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned round, and confronted a little man with his legs astraddle, and
      his hands in his pockets. He had light-gray eyes, red all round the lids,
      bristling pepper-colored hair, an unnaturally rosy complexion, and an
      eager, impudent, clever look. I made two discoveries in one glance at him:
      First, that he was a wretched subject for a portrait; secondly, that,
      whatever he might do or say, it would not be of the least use for me to
      stand on my dignity with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be ready directly, sir,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready directly?&rdquo; repeated my new sitter. &ldquo;What do you mean, Mr. Artist,
      by ready directly? I&rsquo;m ready now. What was your contract with the Town
      Council, who have subscribed for this picture? To paint the portrait. And
      what was my contract? To sit for it. Here am I ready to sit, and there are
      you not ready to paint me. According to all the rules of law and logic,
      you are committing a breach of contract already. Stop! let&rsquo;s have a look
      at your paints. Are they the best quality? If not, I warn you, sir,
      there&rsquo;s a second breach of contract! Brushes, too? Why, they&rsquo;re old
      brushes, by the Lord Harry! The Town Council pays you well, Mr. Artist;
      why don&rsquo;t you work for them with new brushes? What? you work best with
      old? I contend, sir, that you can&rsquo;t. Does my housemaid clean best with an
      old broom? Do my clerks write best with old pens? Don&rsquo;t color up, and
      don&rsquo;t look as if you were going to quarrel with me! You can&rsquo;t quarrel with
      me. If you were fifty times as irritable a man as you look, you couldn&rsquo;t
      quarrel with me. I&rsquo;m not young, and I&rsquo;m not touchy&mdash;I&rsquo;m Boxsious, the
      lawyer; the only man in the world who can&rsquo;t be insulted, try it how you
      like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled as he said this, and walked away to the window. It was quite
      useless to take anything he said seriously, so I finished preparing my
      palette for the morning&rsquo;s work with the utmost serenity of look and manner
      that I could possibly assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he went on, looking out of the window; &ldquo;do you see that fat man
      slouching along the Parade, with a snuffy nose? That&rsquo;s my favorite enemy,
      Dunball. He tried to quarrel with me ten years ago, and he has done
      nothing but bring out the hidden benevolence of my character ever since.
      Look at him! look how he frowns as he turns this way. And now look at me!
      I can smile and nod to him. I make a point of always smiling and nodding
      to him&mdash;it keeps my hand in for other enemies. Good-morning! (I&rsquo;ve
      cast him twice in heavy damages) good-morning, Mr. Dunball. He bears
      malice, you see; he won&rsquo;t speak; he&rsquo;s short in the neck, passionate, and
      four times as fat as he ought to be; he has fought against my amiability
      for ten mortal years; when he can&rsquo;t fight any longer, he&rsquo;ll die suddenly,
      and I shall be the innocent cause of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boxsious uttered this fatal prophecy with extraordinary complacency,
      nodding and smiling out of the window all the time at the unfortunate man
      who had rashly tried to provoke him. When his favorite enemy was out of
      sight, he turned away, and indulged himself in a brisk turn or two up and
      down the room. Meanwhile I lifted my canvas on the easel, and was on the
      point of asking him to sit down, when he assailed me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Artist,&rdquo; he cried, quickening his walk impatiently, &ldquo;in the
      interests of the Town Council, your employers, allow me to ask you for the
      last time when you are going to begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And allow me, Mr. Boxsious, in the interest of the Town Council also,&rdquo;
       said I, &ldquo;to ask you if your notion of the proper way of sitting for your
      portrait is to walk about the room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! well put&mdash;devilish well put!&rdquo; returned Mr. Boxsious; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      the only sensible thing you have said since you entered my house; I begin
      to like you already.&rdquo; With these words he nodded at me approvingly, and
      jumped into the high chair that I had placed for him with the alacrity of
      a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Mr. Artist,&rdquo; he went on, when I had put him into the right
      position (he insisted on the front view of his face being taken, because
      the Town Council would get the most for their money in that way), &ldquo;you
      don&rsquo;t have many such good jobs as this, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I should not be a poor man if commissions for
      life-size portraits often fell in my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Boxsious, contemptuously. &ldquo;I dispute that point
      with you at the outset. Why, you&rsquo;ve got a good cloth coat, a clean shirt,
      and a smooth-shaved chin. You&rsquo;ve got the sleek look of a man who has slept
      between sheets and had his breakfast. You can&rsquo;t humbug me about poverty,
      for I know what it is. Poverty means looking like a scarecrow, feeling
      like a scarecrow, and getting treated like a scarecrow. That was <i>my</i>
      luck, let me tell you, when I first thought of trying the law. Poverty,
      indeed! Do you shake in your shoes, Mr. Artist, when you think what you
      were at twenty? I do, I can promise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to shift about so irritably in his chair, that, in the interests
      of my work, I was obliged to make an effort to calm him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a pleasant occupation for you in your present prosperity,&rdquo;
       said I, &ldquo;to look back sometimes at the gradual processes by which you
      passed from poverty to competence, and from that to the wealth you now
      enjoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gradual, did you say?&rdquo; cried Mr. Boxsious; &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t gradual at all. I
      was sharp&mdash;damned sharp, and I jumped at my first start in business
      slap into five hundred pounds in one day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was an extraordinary step in advance,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;I suppose you
      contrived to make some profitable investment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it! I hadn&rsquo;t a spare sixpence to invest with. I won the
      money by my brains, my hands, and my pluck; and, what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m proud of
      having done it. That was rather a curious case, Mr. Artist. Some men might
      be shy of mentioning it; I never was shy in my life and I mention it right
      and left everywhere&mdash;the whole case, just as it happened, except the
      names. Catch me ever committing myself to mentioning names! Mum&rsquo;s the
      word, sir, with yours to command, Thomas Boxsious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you mention &lsquo;the case&rsquo; everywhere,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;perhaps you would not be
      offended with me if I told you I should like to hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man alive! haven&rsquo;t I told you already that I can&rsquo;t be offended? And
      didn&rsquo;t I say a moment ago that I was proud of the case? I&rsquo;ll tell you, Mr.
      Artist&mdash;but stop! I&rsquo;ve got the interests of the Town Council to look
      after in this business. Can you paint as well when I&rsquo;m talking as when I&rsquo;m
      not? Don&rsquo;t sneer, sir; you&rsquo;re not wanted to sneer&mdash;you&rsquo;re wanted to
      give an answer&mdash;yes or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, then,&rdquo; I replied, in his own sharp way. &ldquo;I can always paint the
      better when I am hearing an interesting story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by talking about a story? I&rsquo;m not going to tell you a
      story; I&rsquo;m going to make a statement. A statement is a matter of fact,
      therefore the exact opposite of a story, which is a matter of fiction.
      What I am now going to tell you really happened to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was glad to see that he settled himself quietly in his chair before he
      began. His odd manners and language made such an impression on me at the
      time, that I think I can repeat his &ldquo;statement&rdquo; now, almost word for word
      as he addressed it to me.

    <h2>
      THE LAWYER&rsquo;S STORY OF A STOLEN LETTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I served my time&mdash;never mind in whose office&mdash;and I started in
      business for myself in one of our English country towns, I decline stating
      which. I hadn&rsquo;t a farthing of capital, and my friends in the neighborhood
      were poor and useless enough, with one exception. That exception was Mr.
      Frank Gatliffe, son of Mr. Gatliffe, member for the county, the richest
      man and the proudest for many a mile round about our parts. Stop a bit,
      Mr. Artist, you needn&rsquo;t perk up and look knowing. You won&rsquo;t trace any
      particulars by the name of Gatliffe. I&rsquo;m not bound to commit myself or
      anybody else by mentioning names. I have given you the first that came
      into my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Mr. Frank was a stanch friend of mine, and ready to recommend me
      whenever he got the chance. I had contrived to get him a little timely
      help&mdash;for a consideration, of course&mdash;in borrowing money at a
      fair rate of interest; in fact, I had saved him from the Jews. The money
      was borrowed while Mr. Frank was at college. He came back from college,
      and stopped at home a little while, and then there got spread about all
      our neighborhood a report that he had fallen in love, as the saying is,
      with his young sister&rsquo;s governess, and that his mind was made up to marry
      her. What! you&rsquo;re at it again, Mr. Artist! You want to know her name,
      don&rsquo;t you? What do you think of Smith?
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking as a lawyer, I consider report, in a general way, to be a fool
      and a liar. But in this case report turned out to be something very
      different. Mr. Frank told me he was really in love, and said upon his
      honor (an absurd expression which young chaps of his age are always using)
      he was determined to marry Smith, the governess&mdash;the sweet, darling
      girl, as <i>he</i> called her; but I&rsquo;m not sentimental, and <i>I</i> call
      her Smith, the governess. Well, Mr. Frank&rsquo;s father, being as proud as
      Lucifer, said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; as to marrying the governess, when Mr. Frank wanted
      him to say &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He was a man of business, was old Gatliffe, and he took
      the proper business course. He sent the governess away with a first-rate
      character and a spanking present, and then he, looked about him to get
      something for Mr. Frank to do. While he was looking about, Mr. Frank
      bolted to London after the governess, who had nobody alive belonging to
      her to go to but an aunt&mdash;her father&rsquo;s sister. The aunt refuses to
      let Mr. Frank in without the squire&rsquo;s permission. Mr. Frank writes to his
      father, and says he will marry the girl as soon as he is of age, or shoot
      himself. Up to town comes the squire and his wife and his daughter, and a
      lot of sentimentality, not in the slightest degree material to the present
      statement, takes places among them; and the upshot of it is that old
      Gatliffe is forced into withdrawing the word No, and substituting the word
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t believe he would ever have done it, though, but for one lucky
      peculiarity in the case. The governess&rsquo;s father was a man of good family&mdash;pretty
      nigh as good as Gatliffe&rsquo;s own. He had been in the army; had sold out; set
      up as a wine-merchant&mdash;failed&mdash;died; ditto his wife, as to the
      dying part of it. No relation, in fact, left for the squire to make
      inquiries about but the father&rsquo;s sister&mdash;who had behaved, as old
      Gatliffe said, like a thorough-bred gentlewoman in shutting the door
      against Mr. Frank in the first instance. So, to cut the matter short,
      things were at last made up pleasant enough. The time was fixed for the
      wedding, and an announcement about it&mdash;Marriage in High Life and all
      that&mdash;put into the county paper. There was a regular biography,
      besides, of the governess&rsquo;s father, so as to stop people from talking&mdash;a
      great flourish about his pedigree, and a long account of his services in
      the army; but not a word, mind ye, of his having turned wine-merchant
      afterward. Oh, no&mdash;not a word about that!
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew it, though, for Mr. Frank told me. He hadn&rsquo;t a bit of pride about
      him. He introduced me to his future wife one day when I met him out
      walking, and asked me if I did not think he was a lucky fellow. I don&rsquo;t
      mind admitting that I did, and that I told him so. Ah! but she was one of
      my sort, was that governess. Stood, to the best of my recollection, five
      foot four. Good lissom figure, that looked as if it had never been boxed
      up in a pair of stays. Eyes that made me feel as if I was under a pretty
      stiff cross-examination the moment she looked at me. Fine red,
      kiss-and-come-again sort of lips. Cheeks and complexion&mdash;No, Mr.
      Artist, you wouldn&rsquo;t identify her by her cheeks and complexion, if I drew
      you a picture of them this very moment. She has had a family of children
      since the time I&rsquo;m talking of; and her cheeks are a trifle fatter, and her
      complexion is a shade or two redder now, than when I first met her out
      walking with Mr. Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage was to take place on a Wednesday. I decline mentioning the
      year or the month. I had started as an attorney on my own account&mdash;say
      six weeks, more or less, and was sitting alone in my office on the Monday
      morning before the wedding-day, trying to see my way clear before me and
      not succeeding particularly well, when Mr. Frank suddenly bursts in, as
      white as any ghost that ever was painted, and says he&rsquo;s got the most
      dreadful case for me to advise on, and not an hour to lose in acting on my
      advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this in the way of business, Mr. Frank?&rdquo; says I, stopping him just as
      he was beginning to get sentimental. &ldquo;Yes or no, Mr. Frank?&rdquo; rapping my
      new office paper-knife on the table, to pull him up short all the sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow&rdquo;&mdash;he was always familiar with me&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s in the
      way of business, certainly; but friendship&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to pull him up short again, and regularly examine him as if
      he had been in the witness-box, or he would have kept me talking to no
      purpose half the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Frank,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have any sentimentality mixed up with
      business matters. You please to stop talking, and let me ask questions.
      Answer in the fewest words you can use. Nod when nodding will do instead
      of words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fixed him with my eye for about three seconds, as he sat groaning and
      wriggling in his chair. When I&rsquo;d done fixing him, I gave another rap with
      my paper-knife on the table to startle him up a bit. Then I went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what you have been stating up to the present time,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I
      gather that you are in a scrape which is likely to interfere seriously
      with your marriage on Wednesday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (He nodded, and I cut in again before he could say a word):
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scrape affects your young lady, and goes back to the period of a
      transaction in which her late father was engaged, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (He nods, and I cut in once more):
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a party, who turned up after seeing the announcement of your
      marriage in the paper, who is cognizant of what he oughtn&rsquo;t to know, and
      who is prepared to use his knowledge of the same to the prejudice of the
      young lady and of your marriage, unless he receives a sum of money to
      quiet him? Very well. Now, first of all, Mr. Frank, state what you have
      been told by the young lady herself about the transaction of her late
      father. How did you first come to have any knowledge of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was talking to me about her father one day so tenderly and prettily,
      that she quite excited my interest about him,&rdquo; begins Mr. Frank; &ldquo;and I
      asked her, among other things, what had occasioned his death. She said she
      believed it was distress of mind in the first instance; and added that
      this distress was connected with a shocking secret, which she and her
      mother had kept from everybody, but which she could not keep from me,
      because she was determined to begin her married life by having no secrets
      from her husband.&rdquo; Here Mr. Frank began to get sentimental again, and I
      pulled him up short once more with the paper-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me,&rdquo; Mr. Frank went on, &ldquo;that the great mistake of her father&rsquo;s
      life was his selling out of the army and taking to the wine trade. He had
      no talent for business; things went wrong with him from the first. His
      clerk, it was strongly suspected, cheated him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a bit,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;What was that suspected clerk&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Davager,&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Davager,&rdquo; says I, making a note of it. &ldquo;Go on, Mr. Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His affairs got more and more entangled,&rdquo; says Mr. Frank; &ldquo;he was pressed
      for money in all directions; bankruptcy, and consequent dishonor (as he
      considered it) stared him in the face. His mind was so affected by his
      troubles that both his wife and daughter, toward the last, considered him
      to be hardly responsible for his own acts. In this state of desperation
      and misery, he&mdash;&rdquo; Here Mr. Frank began to hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have two ways in the law of drawing evidence off nice and clear from an
      unwilling client or witness. We give him a fright, or we treat him to a
      joke. I treated Mr. Frank to a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I know what he did. He had a signature to write; and, by
      the most natural mistake in the world, he wrote another gentleman&rsquo;s name
      instead of his own&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to a bill,&rdquo; says Mr. Frank, looking very crestfallen, instead of
      taking the joke. &ldquo;His principal creditor wouldn&rsquo;t wait till he could raise
      the money, or the greater part of it. But he was resolved, if he sold off
      everything, to get the amount and repay&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;drop that. The forgery was discovered. When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before even the first attempt was made to negotiate the bill. He had done
      the whole thing in the most absurdly and innocently wrong way. The person
      whose name he had used was a stanch friend of his, and a relation of his
      wife&rsquo;s&mdash;a good man as well as a rich one. He had influence with the
      chief creditor, and he used it nobly. He had a real affection for the
      unfortunate man&rsquo;s wife, and he proved it generously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the point,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;What did he do? In a business way, what did
      he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He put the false bill into the fire, drew a bill of his own to replace
      it, and then&mdash;only then&mdash;told my dear girl and her mother all
      that had happened. Can you imagine anything nobler?&rdquo; asks Mr. Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking in my professional capacity, I can&rsquo;t imagine anything greener,&rdquo;
       says I. &ldquo;Where was the father? Off, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill in bed,&rdquo; says Mr. Frank, coloring. &ldquo;But he mustered strength enough
      to write a contrite and grateful letter the same day, promising to prove
      himself worthy of the noble moderation and forgiveness extended to him, by
      selling off everything he possessed to repay his money debt. He did sell
      off everything, down to some old family pictures that were heirlooms; down
      to the little plate he had; down to the very tables and chairs that
      furnished his drawing-room. Every farthing of the debt was paid; and he
      was left to begin the world again, with the kindest promises of help from
      the generous man who had forgiven him. It was too late. His crime of one
      rash moment&mdash;atoned for though it had been&mdash;preyed upon his
      mind. He became possessed with the idea that he had lowered himself
      forever in the estimation of his wife and daughter, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died,&rdquo; I cut in. &ldquo;Yes, yes, we know that. Let&rsquo;s go back for a minute
      to the contrite and grateful letter that he wrote. My experience in the
      law, Mr. Frank, has convinced me that if everybody burned everybody else&rsquo;s
      letters, half the courts of justice in this country might shut up shop. Do
      you happen to know whether the letter we are now speaking of contained
      anything like an avowal or confession of the forgery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it did,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Could the writer express his contrition
      properly without making some such confession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite easy, if he had been a lawyer,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;But never mind that; I&rsquo;m
      going to make a guess&mdash;a desperate guess, mind. Should I be
      altogether in error if I thought that this letter had been stolen; and
      that the fingers of Mr. Davager, of suspicious commercial celebrity, might
      possibly be the fingers which took it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I wanted to make you understand,&rdquo; cried Mr. Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he communicate the interesting fact of the theft to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not ventured into my presence. The scoundrel actually had the
      audacity&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;The young lady herself! Sharp practitioner, Mr. Davager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early this morning, when she was walking alone in the shrubbery,&rdquo; Mr.
      Frank goes on, &ldquo;he had the assurance to approach her, and to say that he
      had been watching his opportunity of getting a private interview for days
      past. He then showed her&mdash;actually showed her&mdash;her unfortunate
      father&rsquo;s letter; put into her hands another letter directed to me; bowed,
      and walked off; leaving her half dead with astonishment and terror. If I
      had only happened to be there at the time!&rdquo; says Mr. Frank, shaking his
      fist murderously in the air, by way of a finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the greatest luck in the world that you were not,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Have you
      got that other letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed it to me. It was so remarkably humorous and short, that I
      remember every word of it at this distance of time. It began in this way:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;To Francis Gatliffe, Esq., Jun.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIR&mdash;I have an extremely curious autograph letter to sell. The price
      is a five-hundred-pound note. The young lady to whom you are to be married
      on Wednesday will inform you of the nature of the letter, and the
      genuineness of the autograph. If you refuse to deal, I shall send a copy
      to the local paper, and shall wait on your highly-respected father with
      the original curiosity, on the afternoon of Tuesday next. Having come down
      here on family business, I have put up at the family hotel&mdash;being to
      be heard of at the Gatliffe Arms. Your very obedient servant, ALFRED
      DAVAGER.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clever fellow that,&rdquo; says I, putting the letter into my private drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever!&rdquo; cries Mr. Frank, &ldquo;he ought to be horsewhipped within an inch of
      his life. I would have done it myself; but she made me promise, before she
      told me a word of the matter, to come straight to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was one of the wisest promises you ever made,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
      afford to bully this fellow, whatever else we may do with him. Do you
      think I am saying anything libelous against your excellent father&rsquo;s
      character when I assert that if he saw the letter he would certainly
      insist on your marriage being put off, at the very least?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feeling as my father does about my marriage, he would insist on its being
      dropped altogether, if he saw this letter,&rdquo; says Mr. Frank, with a groan.
      &ldquo;But even that is not the worst of it. The generous, noble girl herself
      says that if the letter appears in the paper, with all the unanswerable
      comments this scoundrel would be sure to add to it, she would rather die
      than hold me to my engagement, even if my father would let me keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this his eyes began to water. He was a weak young fellow, and
      ridiculously fond of her. I brought him back to business with another rap
      of the paper-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up, Mr. Frank,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;I have a question or two more. Did you
      think of asking the young lady whether, to the best of her knowledge, this
      infernal letter was the only written evidence of the forgery now in
      existence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did think directly of asking her that,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and she told me
      she was quite certain that there was no written evidence of the forgery
      except that one letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give Mr. Davager his price for it?&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Mr. Frank, quite peevish with me for asking him such a
      question. He was an easy young chap in money matters, and talked of
      hundreds as most men talk of sixpences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Frank,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you came here to get my help and advice in this
      extremely ticklish business, and you are ready, as I know without asking,
      to remunerate me for all and any of my services at the usual professional
      rate. Now, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to act boldly&mdash;desperately, if you
      like&mdash;on the hit or miss, win all or lose all principle&mdash;in
      dealing with this matter. Here is my proposal. I&rsquo;m going to try if I can&rsquo;t
      do Mr. Davager out of his letter. If I don&rsquo;t succeed before to-morrow
      afternoon, you hand him the money, and I charge you nothing for
      professional services. If I do succeed, I hand you the letter instead of
      Mr. Davager, and you give me the money instead of giving it to him. It&rsquo;s a
      precious risk for me, but I&rsquo;m ready to run it. You must pay your five
      hundred any way. What do you say to my plan? Is it Yes, Mr. Frank, or No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang your questions!&rdquo; cries Mr. Frank, jumping up; &ldquo;you know it&rsquo;s Yes ten
      thousand times over. Only you earn the money and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will be too glad to give it to me. Very good. Now go home.
      Comfort the young lady&mdash;don&rsquo;t let Mr. Davager so much as set eyes on
      you&mdash;keep quiet&mdash;leave everything to me&mdash;and feel as
      certain as you please that all the letters in the world can&rsquo;t stop your
      being married on Wednesday.&rdquo; With these words I hustled him off out of the
      office, for I wanted to be left alone to make my mind up about what I
      should do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing, of course, was to have a look at the enemy. I wrote to
      Mr. Davager, telling him that I was privately appointed to arrange the
      little business matter between himself and &ldquo;another party&rdquo; (no names!) on
      friendly terms; and begging him to call on me at his earliest convenience.
      At the very beginning of the case, Mr. Davager bothered me. His answer
      was, that it would not be convenient to him to call till between six and
      seven in the evening. In this way, you see, he contrived to make me lose
      several precious hours, at a time when minutes almost were of importance.
      I had nothing for it but to be patient, and to give certain instructions,
      before Mr. Davager came, to my boy Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      There never was such a sharp boy of fourteen before, and there never will
      be again, as my boy Tom. A spy to look after Mr. Davager was, of course,
      the first requisite in a case of this kind; and Tom was the smallest,
      quickest, quietest, sharpest, stealthiest little snake of a chap that ever
      dogged a gentleman&rsquo;s steps and kept cleverly out of range of a gentleman&rsquo;s
      eyes. I settled it with the boy that he was not to show at all when Mr.
      Davager came; and that he was to wait to hear me ring the bell when Mr.
      Davager left. If I rang twice, he was to show the gentleman out. If I rang
      once, he was to keep out of the way, and follow the gentleman whereever he
      went till he got back to the inn. Those were the only preparations I could
      make to begin with; being obliged to wait, and let myself be guided by
      what turned up.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a quarter to seven my gentleman came.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the profession of the law we get somehow quite remarkably mixed up with
      ugly people, blackguard people, and dirty people. But far away the ugliest
      and dirtiest blackguard I ever saw in my life was Mr. Alfred Davager. He
      had greasy white hair and a mottled face. He was low in the forehead, fat
      in the stomach, hoarse in the voice, and weak in the legs. Both his eyes
      were bloodshot, and one was fixed in his head. He smelled of spirits, and
      carried a toothpick in his mouth. &ldquo;How are you? I&rsquo;ve just done dinner,&rdquo;
       says he; and he lights a cigar, sits down with his legs crossed, and winks
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried at first to take the measure of him in a wheedling, confidential
      way; but it was no good. I asked him, in a facetious, smiling manner, how
      he had got hold of the letter. He only told me in answer that he had been
      in the confidential employment of the writer of it, and that he had always
      been famous since infancy for a sharp eye to his own interests. I paid him
      some compliments; but he was not to be flattered. I tried to make him lose
      his temper; but he kept it in spite of me. It ended in his driving me to
      my last resource&mdash;I made an attempt to frighten him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we say a word about the money,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;let me put a case, Mr.
      Davager. The pull you have on Mr. Francis Gatliffe is, that you can hinder
      his marriage on Wednesday. Now, suppose I have got a magistrate&rsquo;s warrant
      to apprehend you in my pocket? Suppose I have a constable to execute it in
      the next room? Suppose I bring you up to-morrow&mdash;the day before the
      marriage&mdash;charge you only generally with an attempt to extort money,
      and apply for a day&rsquo;s remand to complete the case? Suppose, as a
      suspicious stranger, you can&rsquo;t get bail in this town? Suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a bit,&rdquo; says Mr. Davager. &ldquo;Suppose I should not be the greenest fool
      that ever stood in shoes? Suppose I should not carry the letter about me?
      Suppose I should have given a certain envelope to a certain friend of mine
      in a certain place in this town? Suppose the letter should be inside that
      envelope, directed to old Gatliffe, side by side with a copy of the letter
      directed to the editor of the local paper? Suppose my friend should be
      instructed to open the envelope, and take the letters to their right
      address, if I don&rsquo;t appear to claim them from him this evening? In short,
      my dear sir, suppose you were born yesterday, and suppose I wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; says
      Mr. Davager, and winks at me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t take me by surprise, for I never expected that he had the letter
      about him. I made a pretense of being very much taken aback, and of being
      quite ready to give in. We settled our business about delivering the
      letter, and handing over the money, in no time. I was to draw out a
      document, which he was to sign. He knew the document was stuff and
      nonsense, just as well as I did, and told me I was only proposing it to
      swell my client&rsquo;s bill. Sharp as he was, he was wrong there. The document
      was not to be drawn out to gain money from Mr. Frank, but to gain time
      from Mr. Davager. It served me as an excuse to put off the payment of the
      five hundred pounds till three o&rsquo;clock on the Tuesday afternoon. The
      Tuesday morning Mr. Davager said he should devote to his amusement, and
      asked me what sights were to be seen in the neighborhood of the town. When
      I had told him, he pitched his toothpick into my grate, yawned, and went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rang the bell once&mdash;waited till he had passed the window&mdash;and
      then looked after Tom. There was my jewel of a boy on the opposite side of
      the street, just setting his top going in the most playful manner
      possible. Mr. Davager walked away up the street toward the market-place.
      Tom whipped his top up the street toward the market-place, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour he came back, with all his evidence collected in a
      beautifully clear and compact state. Mr. Davager had walked to a
      public-house just outside the town, in a lane leading to the highroad. On
      a bench outside the public-house there sat a man smoking. He said &ldquo;All
      right?&rdquo; and gave a letter to Mr. Davager, who answered &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; and
      walked back to the inn. In the hall he ordered hot rum-and-water, cigars,
      slippers, and a fire to be lit in his room. After that he went upstairs,
      and Tom came away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now saw my road clear before me&mdash;not very far on, but still clear.
      I had housed the letter, in all probability for that night, at the
      Gatliffe Arms. After tipping Tom, I gave him directions to play about the
      door of the inn, and refresh himself when he was tired at the tart-shop
      opposite, eating as much as he pleased, on the understanding that he
      crammed all the time with his eye on the window. If Mr. Davager went out,
      or Mr. Davager&rsquo;s friend called on him, Tom was to let me know. He was also
      to take a little note from me to the head chambermaid&mdash;an old friend
      of mine&mdash;asking her to step over to my office, on a private matter of
      business, as soon as her work was done for that night. After settling
      these little matters, having half an hour to spare, I turned to and did
      myself a bloater at the office fire, and had a drop of gin-and-water hot,
      and felt comparatively happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the head chambermaid came, it turned out, as good luck would have it,
      that Mr. Davager had drawn her attention rather too closely to his
      ugliness, by offering her a testimony of his regard in the shape of a
      kiss. I no sooner mentioned him than she flew into a passion; and when I
      added, by way of clinching the matter, that I was retained to defend the
      interests of a very beautiful and deserving young lady (name not referred
      to, of course) against the most cruel underhand treachery on the part of
      Mr. Davager, the head chambermaid was ready to go any lengths that she
      could safely to serve my cause. In a few words I discovered that Boots was
      to call Mr. Davager at eight the next morning, and was to take his clothes
      downstairs to brush as usual. If Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; had not
      emptied his own pockets overnight, we arranged that Boots was to forget to
      empty them for him, and was to bring the clothes downstairs just as he
      found them. If Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s pockets were emptied, then, of
      course, it would be necessary to transfer the searching process to Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      room. Under any circumstances, I was certain of the head chambermaid; and
      under any circumstances, also, the head chambermaid was certain of Boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited till Tom came home, looking very puffy and bilious about the
      face; but as to his intellects, if anything, rather sharper than ever. His
      report was uncommonly short and pleasant. The inn was shutting up; Mr.
      Davager was going to bed in rather a drunken condition; Mr. Davager&rsquo;s
      friend had never appeared. I sent Tom (properly instructed about keeping
      our man in view all the next morning) to his shake-down behind the
      office-desk, where I heard him hiccoughing half the night, as even the
      best boys will, when over-excited and too full of tarts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past seven next morning, I slipped quietly into Boots&rsquo;s pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down came the clothes. No pockets in trousers. Waistcoat-pockets empty.
      Coat-pockets with something in them. First, handkerchief; secondly, bunch
      of keys; thirdly, cigar-case; fourthly, pocketbook. Of course I wasn&rsquo;t
      such a fool as to expect to find the letter there, but I opened the
      pocketbook with a certain curiosity, notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in the two pockets of the book but some old advertisements cut out
      of newspapers, a lock of hair tied round with a dirty bit of ribbon, a
      circular letter about a loan society, and some copies of verses not likely
      to suit any company that was not of an extremely free-and-easy
      description. On the leaves of the pocketbook, people&rsquo;s addresses scrawled
      in pencil, and bets jotted down in red ink. On one leaf, by itself, this
      queer inscription:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MEM. 5 ALONG. 4 ACROSS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I understood everything but those words and figures, so of course I copied
      them out into my own book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I waited in the pantry till Boots had brushed the clothes, and had
      taken them upstairs. His report when he came down was, that Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      had asked if it was a fine morning. Being told that it was, he had ordered
      breakfast at nine, and a saddle-horse to be at the door at ten, to take
      him to Grimwith Abbey&mdash;one of the sights in our neighborhood which I
      had told him of the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here, coming in by the back way, at half-past ten,&rdquo; says I to the
      head chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take the responsibility of making Mr. Davager&rsquo;s bed off your hands for
      this morning only,&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any more orders?&rdquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;I want to hire Sam for the morning. Put it down in
      the order-book that he&rsquo;s to be brought round to my office at ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In case you should think Sam was a man, I&rsquo;d better perhaps tell you he was
      a pony. I&rsquo;d made up my mind that it would be beneficial to Tom&rsquo;s health,
      after the tarts, if he took a constitutional airing on a nice hard saddle
      in the direction of Grimwith Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; says the head chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one more favor,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Would my boy Tom be very much in the way
      if he came, from now till ten, to help with the boots and shoes, and stood
      at his work close by this window which looks out on the staircase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; says the head chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; says I; and stepped back to my office directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had sent Tom off to help with the boots and shoes, I reviewed the
      whole case exactly as it stood at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three things Mr. Davager might do with the letter. He might
      give it to his friend again before ten&mdash;in which case Tom would most
      likely see the said friend on the stairs. He might take it to his friend,
      or to some other friend, after ten&mdash;in which case Tom was ready to
      follow him on Sam the pony. And, lastly, he might leave it hidden
      somewhere in his room at the inn&mdash;in which case I was all ready for
      him with a search-warrant of my own granting, under favor always of my
      friend the head chambermaid. So far I had my business arrangements all
      gathered up nice and compact in my own hands. Only two things bothered me;
      the terrible shortness of the time at my disposal, in case I failed in my
      first experiments, for getting hold of the letter, and that queer
      inscription which I had copied out of the pocketbook:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MEM. 5 ALONG. 4 ACROSS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the measurement most likely of something, and he was afraid of
      forgetting it; therefore it was something important. Query&mdash;something
      about himself? Say &ldquo;5&rdquo; (inches) &ldquo;along&rdquo;&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t wear a wig. Say
      &ldquo;5&rdquo; (feet) &ldquo;along&rdquo;&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be coat, waistcoat, trousers, or
      underclothing. Say &ldquo;5&rdquo; (yards) &ldquo;along&rdquo;&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be anything about
      himself, unless he wears round his body the rope that he&rsquo;s sure to be
      hanged with one of these days. Then it is <i>not</i> something about
      himself. What do I know of that is important to him besides? I know of
      nothing but the Letter. Can the memorandum be connected with that? Say,
      yes. What do &ldquo;5 along&rdquo; and &ldquo;4 across&rdquo; mean, then? The measurement of
      something he carries about with him? or the measurement of something in
      his room? I could get pretty satisfactorily to myself as far as that; but
      I could get no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom came back to the office, and reported him mounted for his ride. His
      friend had never appeared. I sent the boy off, with his proper
      instructions, on Sam&rsquo;s back&mdash;wrote an encouraging letter to Mr. Frank
      to keep him quiet&mdash;then slipped into the inn by the back way a little
      before half-past ten. The head chambermaid gave me a signal when the
      landing was clear. I got into his room without a soul but her seeing me,
      and locked the door immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case was, to a certain extent, simplified now. Either Mr. Davager had
      ridden out with the letter about him, or he had left it in some safe
      hiding-place in his room. I suspected it to be in his room, for a reason
      that will a little astonish you&mdash;his trunk, his dressing-case, and
      all the drawers and cupboards, were left open. I knew my customer, and I
      thought this extraordinary carelessness on his part rather suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davager had taken one of the best bedrooms at the Gatliffe Arms. Floor
      carpeted all over, walls beautifully papered, four-poster, and general
      furniture first-rate. I searched, to begin with, on the usual plan,
      examining everything in every possible way, and taking more than an hour
      about it. No discovery. Then I pulled out a carpenter&rsquo;s rule which I had
      brought with me. Was there anything in the room which&mdash;either in
      inches, feet, or yards&mdash;answered to &ldquo;5 along&rdquo; and &ldquo;4 across&rdquo;?
      Nothing. I put the rule back in my pocket&mdash;measurement was no good,
      evidently. Was there anything in the room that would count up to 5 one way
      and 4 another, seeing that nothing would measure up to it? I had got
      obstinately persuaded by this time that the letter must be in the room&mdash;principally
      because of the trouble I had had in looking after it. And persuading
      myself of that, I took it into my head next, just as obstinately, that &ldquo;5
      along&rdquo; and &ldquo;4 across&rdquo; must be the right clew to find the letter by&mdash;principally
      because I hadn&rsquo;t left myself, after all my searching and thinking, even so
      much as the ghost of another guide to go by. &ldquo;Five along&rdquo;&mdash;where
      could I count five along the room, in any part of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not on the paper. The pattern there was pillars of trellis-work and
      flowers, inclosing a plain green ground&mdash;only four pillars along the
      wall and only two across. The furniture? There were not five chairs or
      five separate pieces of any furniture in the room altogether. The fringes
      that hung from the cornice of the bed? Plenty of them, at any rate! Up I
      jumped on the counterpane, with my pen-knife in my hand. Every way that &ldquo;5
      along&rdquo; and &ldquo;4 across&rdquo; could be reckoned on those unlucky fringes I
      reckoned on them&mdash;probed with my penknife&mdash;scratched with my
      nails&mdash;crunched with my fingers. No use; not a sign of a letter; and
      the time was getting on&mdash;oh, Lord! how the time did get on in Mr.
      Davager&rsquo;s room that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jumped down from the bed, so desperate at my ill luck that I hardly
      cared whether anybody heard me or not. Quite a little cloud of dust rose
      at my feet as they thumped on the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;my friend the head chambermaid takes it easy here.
      Nice state for a carpet to be in, in one of the best bedrooms at the
      Gatliffe Arms.&rdquo; Carpet! I had been jumping up on the bed, and staring up
      at the walls, but I had never so much as given a glance down at the
      carpet. Think of me pretending to be a lawyer, and not knowing how to look
      low enough!
    </p>

      The carpet! It had been a stout article in its time, had evidently began
      in a drawing-room; then descended to a coffee-room; then gone upstairs
      altogether to a bedroom. The ground was brown, and the pattern was bunches
      of leaves and roses speckled over the ground at regular distances. I
      reckoned up the bunches. Ten along the room&mdash;eight across it. When I
      had stepped out five one way and four the other, and was down on my knees
      on the center bunch, as true as I sit on this chair I could hear my own
      heart beating so loud that it quite frightened me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked narrowly all over the bunch, and I felt all over it with the ends
      of my fingers, and nothing came of that. Then I scraped it over slowly and
      gently with my nails. My second finger-nail stuck a little at one place. I
      parted the pile of the carpet over that place, and saw a thin slit which
      had been hidden by the pile being smoothed over it&mdash;a slit about half
      an inch long, with a little end of brown thread, exactly the color of the
      carpet ground, sticking out about a quarter of an inch from the middle of
      it. Just as I laid hold of the thread gently, I heard a footstep outside
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only the head chambermaid. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you done yet?&rdquo; she whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me two minutes,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t let anybody come near the door&mdash;whatever
      you do, don&rsquo;t let anybody startle me again by coming near the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took a little pull at the thread, and heard something rustle. I took a
      longer pull, and out came a piece of paper, rolled up tight like those
      candle-lighters that the ladies make. I unrolled it&mdash;and, by George!
      there was the letter!
    </p>
    <p>
      The original letter! I knew it by the color of the ink. The letter that
      was worth five hundred pounds to me! It was all that I could do to keep
      myself at first from throwing my hat into the air, and hurrahing like mad.
      I had to take a chair and sit quiet in it for a minute or two, before I
      could cool myself down to my proper business level. I knew that I was
      safely down again when I found myself pondering how to let Mr. Davager
      know that he had been done by the innocent country attorney, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before a nice little irritating plan occurred to me. I
      tore a blank leaf out of my pocketbook, wrote on it with my pencil,
      &ldquo;Change for a five-hundred-pound note,&rdquo; folded up the paper, tied the
      thread to it, poked it back into the hiding-place, smoothed over the pile
      of the carpet, and then bolted off to Mr. Frank. He in his turn bolted off
      to show the letter to the young lady, who first certified to its
      genuineness, then dropped it into the fire, and then took the initiative
      for the first time since her marriage engagement, by flinging her arms
      round his neck, kissing him with all her might, and going into hysterics
      in his arms. So at least Mr. Frank told me, but that&rsquo;s not evidence. It is
      evidence, however, that I saw them married with my own eyes on the
      Wednesday; and that while they went off in a carriage-and-four to spend
      the honeymoon, I went off on my own legs to open a credit at the Town and
      County Bank with a five-hundred-pound note in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Mr. Davager, I can tell you nothing more about him, except what is
      derived from hearsay evidence, which is always unsatisfactory evidence,
      even in a lawyer&rsquo;s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My inestimable boy, Tom, although twice kicked off by Sam the pony, never
      lost hold of the bridle, and kept his man in sight from first to last. He
      had nothing particular to report except that on the way out to the Abbey
      Mr. Davager had stopped at the public-house, had spoken a word or two to
      his friend of the night before, and had handed him what looked like a bit
      of paper. This was no doubt a clew to the thread that held the letter, to
      be used in case of accidents. In every other respect Mr. D. had ridden out
      and ridden in like an ordinary sightseer. Tom reported him to me as having
      dismounted at the hotel about two. At half-past I locked my office door,
      nailed a card under the knocker with &ldquo;not at home till to-morrow&rdquo; written
      on it, and retired to a friend&rsquo;s house a mile or so out of the town for
      the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davager, I have been since given to understand, left the Gatliffe Arms
      that same night with his best clothes on his back, and with all the
      valuable contents of his dressing-case in his pockets. I am not in a
      condition to state whether he ever went through the form of asking for his
      bill or not; but I can positively testify that he never paid it, and that
      the effects left in his bedroom did not pay it either. When I add to these
      fragments of evidence that he and I have never met (luckily for me, you
      will say) since I jockeyed him out of his banknote, I have about fulfilled
      my implied contract as maker of a statement with you, sir, as hearer of a
      statement. Observe the expression, will you? I said it was a Statement
      before I began; and I say it&rsquo;s a Statement now I&rsquo;ve done. I defy you to
      prove it&rsquo;s a Story! How are you getting on with my portrait? I like you
      very well, Mr. Artist; but if you have been taking advantage of my talking
      to shirk your work, as sure as you&rsquo;re alive I&rsquo;ll split upon you to the
      Town Council!
    </p>
    <p>
      I attended a great many times at my queer sitter&rsquo;s house before his
      likeness was completed. To the last he was dissatisfied with the progress
      I made. Fortunately for me, the Town Council approved of the portrait when
      it was done. Mr. Boxsious, however, objected to them as being much too
      easy to please. He did not dispute the fidelity of the likeness, but he
      asserted that I had not covered the canvas with half paint enough for my
      money. To this day (for he is still alive), he describes me to all
      inquiring friends as &ldquo;The Painter-Man who jockeyed the Town Council.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      PROLOGUE TO THE THIRD STORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a sad day for me when Mr. Lanfray, of Rockleigh Place, discovering
      that his youngest daughter&rsquo;s health required a warm climate, removed from
      his English establishment to the South of France. Roving from place to
      place, as I am obliged to do, though I make many acquaintances, I keep but
      few friends. The nature of my calling is, I am quite aware, mainly
      answerable for this. People cannot be blamed for forgetting a man who, on
      leaving their houses, never can tell them for certain when he is likely to
      be in their neighborhood again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lanfray was one of the few exceptional persons who always remembered
      me. I have proofs of his friendly interest in my welfare in the shape of
      letters which I treasure with grateful care. The last of these is an
      invitation to his house in the South of France. There is little chance at
      present of my being able to profit by his kindness; but I like to read his
      invitation from time to time, for it makes me fancy, in my happier
      moments, that I may one day really be able to accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My introduction to this gentleman, in my capacity of portrait-painter, did
      not promise much for me in a professional point of view. I was invited to
      Rockleigh&mdash;or to &ldquo;The Place,&rdquo; as it was more frequently called among
      the people of the county&mdash;to take a likeness in water-colors, on a
      small scale, of the French governess who lived with Mr. Lanfray&rsquo;s
      daughters. My first idea on hearing of this was, that the governess was
      about to leave her situation, and that her pupils wished to have a
      memorial of her in the shape of a portrait. Subsequent inquiry, however,
      informed me that I was in error. It was the eldest of Mr. Lanfray&rsquo;s
      daughters, who was on the point of leaving the house to accompany her
      husband to India; and it was for her that the portrait had been ordered as
      a home remembrance of her best and dearest friend. Besides these
      particulars, I discovered that the governess, though still called
      &ldquo;mademoiselle,&rdquo; was an old lady; that Mr. Lanfray had been introduced to
      her many years since in France, after the death of his wife; that she was
      absolute mistress in the house; and that her three pupils had always
      looked up to her as a second mother, from the time when their father first
      placed them under her charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      These scraps of information made me rather anxious to see Mademoiselle
      Clairfait, the governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day appointed for my attendance at the comfortable country house of
      Rockleigh, I was detained on the road, and did not arrive at my
      destination until late in the evening. The welcome accorded to me by Mr.
      Lanfray gave an earnest of the unvarying kindness that I was to experience
      at his hands in after-life. I was received at once on equal terms, as if I
      had been a friend of the family, and was presented the same evening to my
      host&rsquo;s daughters. They were not merely three elegant and attractive young
      women, but&mdash;what means much more than that&mdash;three admirable
      subjects for pictures, the bride particularly. Her young husband did not
      strike me much at first sight; he seemed rather shy and silent. After I
      had been introduced to him, I looked round for Mademoiselle Clairfait, but
      she was not present; and I was soon afterward informed by Mr. Lanfray that
      she always spent the latter part of the evening in her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the breakfast-table the next morning, I again looked for my sitter, and
      once more in vain. &ldquo;Mamma, as we call her,&rdquo; said one of the ladies, &ldquo;is
      dressing expressly for her picture, Mr. Kerby. I hope you are not above
      painting silk, lace, and jewelry. The dear old lady, who is perfection in
      everything else, is perfection also in dress, and is bent on being painted
      in all her splendor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This explanation prepared me for something extraordinary; but I found that
      my anticipations had fallen far below the reality when Mademoiselle
      Clairfait at last made her appearance, and announced that she was ready to
      sit for her portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before or since have I seen such perfect dressing and such active
      old age in combination. &ldquo;Mademoiselle&rdquo; was short and thin; her face was
      perfectly white all over, the skin being puckered up in an infinite
      variety of the smallest possible wrinkles. Her bright black eyes were
      perfect marvels of youthfulness and vivacity. They sparkled, and beamed,
      and ogled, and moved about over everybody and everything at such a rate,
      that the plain gray hair above them looked unnaturally venerable, and the
      wrinkles below an artful piece of masquerade to represent old age. As for
      her dress, I remember few harder pieces of work than the painting of it.
      She wore a silver-gray silk gown that seemed always flashing out into some
      new light whenever she moved. It was as stiff as a board, and rustled like
      the wind. Her head, neck, and bosom were enveloped in clouds of the
      airiest-looking lace I ever saw, disposed about each part of her with the
      most exquisite grace and propriety, and glistening at all sorts of
      unexpected places with little fairy-like toys in gold and precious stones.
      On her right wrist she wore three small bracelets, with the hair of her
      three pupils worked into them; and on her left, one large bracelet with a
      miniature let in over the clasp. She had a dark crimson and gold scarf
      thrown coquettishly over her shoulders, and held a lovely little
      feather-fan in her hand. When she first presented herself before me in
      this costume, with a brisk courtesy and a bright smile, filling the room
      with perfume, and gracefully flirting the feather-fan, I lost all
      confidence in my powers as a portrait-painter immediately. The brightest
      colors in my box looked dowdy and dim, and I myself felt like an unwashed,
      unbrushed, unpresentable sloven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, my angels,&rdquo; said mademoiselle, apostrophizing her pupils in the
      prettiest foreign English, &ldquo;am I the cream of all creams this morning? Do
      I carry my sixty years resplendently? Will the savages in India, when my
      own love exhibits my picture among them, say, &lsquo;Ah! smart! smart! this was
      a great dandy?&rsquo; And the gentleman, the skillful artist, whom it is even
      more an honor than a happiness to meet, does he approve of me for a model?
      Does he find me pretty and paintable from top to toe?&rdquo; Here she dropped me
      another brisk courtesy, placed herself in a languishing position in the
      sitter&rsquo;s chair, and asked us all if she looked like a shepherdess in
      Dresden china.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies burst out laughing, and mademoiselle, as gay as any of
      them and a great deal shriller, joined in the merriment. Never before had
      I contended with any sitter half as restless as that wonderful old lady.
      No sooner had I begun than she jumped out of the chair, and exclaiming, &ldquo;<i>Grand
      Dieu!</i> I have forgotten to embrace my angels this morning,&rdquo; ran up to
      her pupils, raised herself on tiptoe before them in quick succession, put
      the two first fingers of each hand under their ears, kissed them lightly
      on both cheeks, and was back again in the chair before an English
      governess could have said, &ldquo;Good-morning, my dears, I hope you all slept
      well last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began again. Up jumped mademoiselle for the second time, and tripped
      across the room to a cheval-glass. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; I heard her say to herself, &ldquo;I
      have not discomposed my head in kissing my angels. I may come back and
      pose for my picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back she came. I worked from her for five minutes at the most. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
       cries mademoiselle, jumping up for the third time; &ldquo;I must see how this
      skillful artist is getting on. <i>Grand Dieu!</i> why he has done
      nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the fourth time I began, and for the fourth time the old lady started
      out of her chair. &ldquo;Now I must repose myself,&rdquo; said mademoiselle, walking
      lightly from end to end of the room, and humming a French air, by way of
      taking a rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was at my wit&rsquo;s end, and the young ladies saw it. They all surrounded my
      unmanageable sitter, and appealed to her compassion for me. &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;
       said mademoiselle, expressing astonishment by flinging up both her hands
      with all the fingers spread out in the air. &ldquo;But why apostrophize me thus?
      I am here, I am ready, I am at the service of this skillful artist. Why
      apostrophize me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fortunate chance question of mine steadied her for some time. I inquired
      if I was expected to draw the whole of my sitter&rsquo;s figure as well as her
      face. Mademoiselle replied by a comic scream of indignation. If I was the
      brave and gifted man for whom she took me, I ought to be ready to perish
      rather than leave out an inch of her anywhere. Dress was her passion, and
      it would be an outrage on her sentiments if I did not do full justice to
      everything she had on&mdash;to her robe, to her lace, to her scarf, to her
      fan, to her rings, her jewels, and, above all, to her bracelets. I groaned
      in spirit at the task before me, but made my best bow of acquiescence.
      Mademoiselle was not to be satisfied by a mere bow; she desired the
      pleasure of specially directing my attention, if I would be so amiable as
      to get up and approach her, to one of her bracelets in particular&mdash;the
      bracelet with the miniature, on her left wrist. It had been the gift of
      the dearest friend she ever had, and the miniature represented that
      friend&rsquo;s beloved and beautiful face. Could I make a tiny, tiny copy of
      that likeness in my drawing! Would I only be so obliging as to approach
      for one little moment, and see if such a thing were possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed unwillingly enough, expecting, from mademoiselle&rsquo;s expression, to
      see a commonplace portrait of some unfortunate admirer whom she had
      treated with unmerited severity in the days of her youth. To my
      astonishment, I found that the miniature, which was very beautifully
      painted, represented a woman&rsquo;s face&mdash;a young woman with kind, sad
      eyes, pale, delicate cheeks, light hair, and such a pure, tender, lovely
      expressions that I thought of Raphael&rsquo;s Madonnas the moment I looked at
      her portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady observed the impression which the miniature produced on me,
      and nodded her head in silence. &ldquo;What a beautiful, innocent, pure face!&rdquo; I
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Clairfait gently brushed a particle of dust from the
      miniature with her handkerchief, and kissed it. &ldquo;I have three angels still
      left,&rdquo; she said, looking at her pupils. &ldquo;They console me for the fourth,
      who has gone to heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She patted the face on the miniature gently with her little, withered,
      white fingers, as if it had been a living thing. <i>&ldquo;Sister Rose!&rdquo;</i> she
      sighed to herself; then, looking up again at me, said, &ldquo;I should like it
      put into my portrait, sir, because I have always worn it since I was a
      young woman, for &lsquo;Sister Rose&rsquo;s&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden change in her manner, from the extreme of flighty gayety to the
      extreme of quiet sadness, would have looked theatrical in a woman of any
      other nation. It seemed, however, perfectly natural and appropriate in
      her. I went back to my drawing, rather perplexed. Who was &ldquo;Sister Rose&rdquo;?
      Not one of the Lanfray family, apparently. The composure of the young
      ladies when the name was mentioned showed plainly enough that the original
      of the miniature had been no relation of theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to stifle my curiosity on the subject of Sister Rose, by giving
      myself entirely to my work. For a full half-hour, Mademoiselle Clairfait
      sat quietly before me, with her hands crossed on her lap, and her eyes
      fixed on the bracelet. This happy alteration enabled me to do something
      toward completing the outline of her face and figure. I might even, under
      fortunate circumstances, have vanquished the preliminary difficulties of
      my task at one effort; but the fates were against me that day. While I was
      still working rapidly and to my satisfaction, a servant knocked at the
      door to announce luncheon, and mademoiselle lightly roused herself from
      her serious reflection and her quiet position in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah me!&rdquo; she said, turning the miniature round on her wrist till it was
      out of sight. &ldquo;What animals we are, after all! The spiritual part of us is
      at the mercy of the stomach. My heart is absorbed by tender thoughts, yet
      I am not the less ready for luncheon! Come, my children and
      fellow-mortals. <i>Allons cultiver notre jardin!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this quotation from &ldquo;Candide,&rdquo; plaintively delivered, the old lady
      led the way out of the room, and was followed by her younger pupils. The
      eldest sister remained behind for a moment, and reminded me that the lunch
      was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you have found the dear old soul rather an unruly sitter,&rdquo;
       she said, noticing the look of dissatisfaction with which I was regarding
      my drawing. &ldquo;But she will improve as you go on. She has done better
      already for the last half-hour, has she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;My admiration of the miniature on the bracelet
      seemed&mdash;I suppose, by calling up some old associations&mdash;to have
      a strangely soothing effect on Mademoiselle Clairfait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes! only remind her of the original of that portrait, and you change
      her directly, whatever she may have been saying or doing the moment
      before. Sometimes she talks of <i>Sister Rose,</i> and of all that she
      went through in the time of the French Revolution, by the hour together.
      It is wonderfully interesting&mdash;at least we all think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume that the lady described as &lsquo;Sister Rose&rsquo; was a relation of
      Mademoiselle Clairfait&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only a very dear friend. Mademoiselle Clairfait is the daughter of a
      silk-mercer, once established at Chalons-sur-Marne. Her father happened to
      give an asylum in his office to a lonely old man, to whom &lsquo;Sister Rose&rsquo;
      and her brother had been greatly indebted in the revolutionary time; and
      out of a train of circumstances connected with that, the first
      acquaintance between mademoiselle and the friend whose portrait she wears,
      arose. After the time of her father&rsquo;s bankruptcy, and for many years
      before we were placed under her charge, our good old governess lived
      entirely with &lsquo;Sister Rose&rsquo; and her brother. She must then have heard all
      the interesting things that she has since often repeated to my sisters and
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I suggest,&rdquo; said I, after an instant&rsquo;s consideration, &ldquo;that the
      best way to give me a fair chance of studying Mademoiselle Clairfait&rsquo;s
      face at the next sitting, would be to lead her thoughts again to that
      quieting subject of the miniature, and to the events which the portrait
      recalls? It is really the only plan, after what I have observed this
      morning, that I can think of for enabling me to do myself and my sitter
      justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear you say so,&rdquo; replied the lady; &ldquo;for the execution
      of your plan, by me or by my sisters, will be the easiest thing in the
      world. A word from us at any time will set mademoiselle thinking, and
      talking too, of the friend of her youthful days. Depend on our assistance
      so far. And now let me show you the way to the luncheon-table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two good results followed the ready rendering of the help I had asked from
      my host&rsquo;s daughters. I succeeded with my portrait of Mademoiselle
      Clairfait, and I heard the story which occupies the following pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of the preceding narratives, I have repeated what was related
      to me, as nearly as possible in the very words of my sitters. In the case
      of this third story, it is impossible for me to proceed upon the same
      plan. The circumstances of &ldquo;Sister Rose&rsquo;s&rdquo; eventful history were narrated
      to me at different times, and in the most fragmentary and discursive
      manner. Mademoiselle Clairfait characteristically mixed up with the direct
      interest of her story, not only references to places and people which had
      no recognizable connection with it, but outbursts of passionate political
      declamation, on the extreme liberal side&mdash;to say nothing of little
      tender apostrophes to her beloved friend, which sounded very prettily as
      she spoke them, but which would lose their effect altogether by being
      transferred to paper. Under these circumstances, I have thought it best to
      tell the story in my own way&mdash;rigidly adhering to the events of it
      exactly as they were related; and never interfering on my own
      responsibility except to keep order in the march of the incidents, and to
      present them, to the best of my ability, variously as well as
      interestingly to the reader.

      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Well, Monsieur Guillaume, what is the news this evening?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None that I know of, Monsieur Justin, except that Mademoiselle Rose is to
      be married to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged, my respectable old friend, for so interesting and
      unexpected a reply to my question. Considering that I am the valet of
      Monsieur Danville, who plays the distinguished part of bridegroom in the
      little wedding comedy to which you refer, I think I may assure you,
      without offense, that your news is, so far as I am concerned, of the
      stalest possible kind. Take a pinch of snuff, Monsieur Guillaume, and
      excuse me if I inform you that my question referred to public news, and
      not to the private affairs of the two families whose household interests
      we have the pleasure of promoting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean by such a phrase as promoting household
      interests, Monsieur Justin. I am the servant of Monsieur Louis Trudaine,
      who lives here with his sister, Mademoiselle Rose. You are the servant of
      Monsieur Danville, whose excellent mother has made up the match for him
      with my young lady. As servants, both of us, the pleasantest news we can
      have any concern with is news that is connected with the happiness of our
      masters. I have nothing to do with public affairs; and, being one of the
      old school, I make it my main object in life to mind my own business. If
      our homely domestic politics have no interests for you, allow me to
      express my regret, and to wish you a very good-evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, my dear sir, I have not the slightest respect for the old
      school, or the least sympathy with people who only mind their own
      business. However, I accept your expressions of regret; I reciprocate your
      &lsquo;Good-evening&rsquo;; and I trust to find you improved in temper, dress,
      manners, and appearance the next time I have the honor of meeting you.
      Adieu, Monsieur Guillaume, and! <i>Vive la bagatelle!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      These scraps of dialogue were interchanged on a lovely summer evening in
      the year seventeen hundred and eighty-nine, before the back door of a
      small house which stood on the banks of the Seine, about three miles
      westward of the city of Rouen. The one speaker was lean, old, crabbed and
      slovenly; the other was plump, young, oily-mannered and dressed in the
      most gorgeous livery costume of the period. The last days of genuine
      dandyism were then rapidly approaching all over the civilized world; and
      Monsieur Justin was, in his own way, dressed to perfection, as a living
      illustration of the expiring glories of his epoch.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the old servant had left him, he occupied himself for a few minutes
      in contemplating, superciliously enough, the back view of the little house
      before which he stood. Judging by the windows, it did not contain more
      than six or eight rooms in all. Instead of stables and outhouses, there
      was a conservatory attached to the building on one side, and a low, long
      room, built of wood, gayly painted, on the other. One of the windows of
      this room was left uncurtained and through it could be seen, on a sort of
      dresser inside, bottles filled with strangely-colored liquids oddly-shaped
      utensils of brass and copper, one end of a large furnace, and other
      objects, which plainly proclaimed that the apartment was used as a
      chemical laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of our bride&rsquo;s brother amusing himself in such a place as that with
      cooking drugs in saucepans,&rdquo; muttered Monsieur Justin, peeping into the
      room. &ldquo;I am the least particular man in the universe, but I must say I
      wish we were not going to be connected by marriage with an amateur
      apothecary. Pah! I can smell the place through the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words Monsieur Justin turned his back on the laboratory in
      disgust, and sauntered toward the cliffs overhanging the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the garden attached to the house, he ascended some gently rising
      ground by a winding path. Arrived at the summit, the whole view of the
      Seine, with its lovely green islands, its banks fringed with trees, its
      gliding boats, and little scattered water-side cottages, opened before
      him. Westward, where the level country appeared beyond the further bank of
      the river, the landscape was all aglow with the crimson of the setting
      sun. Eastward, the long shadows and mellow intervening lights, the red
      glory that quivered on the rippling water, the steady ruby fire glowing on
      cottage windows that reflected the level sunlight, led the eye onward and
      onward, along the windings of the Seine, until it rested upon the spires,
      towers, and broadly-massed houses of Rouen, with the wooded hills rising
      beyond them for background. Lovely to look on at any time, the view was
      almost supernaturally beautiful now under the gorgeous evening light that
      glowed up in it. All its attractions, however, were lost on the valet; he
      stood yawning with his hands in his pockets, looking neither to the right
      nor to the left, but staring straight before him at a little hollow,
      beyond which the ground sloped away smoothly to the brink of the cliff. A
      bench was placed here, and three persons&mdash;an old lady, a gentleman,
      and a young girl&mdash;were seated on it, watching the sunset, and by
      consequence turning their backs on Monsieur Justin. Near them stood two
      gentlemen, also looking toward the river and the distant view. These five
      figures attracted the valet&rsquo;s attention, to the exclusion of every other
      object around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they are still,&rdquo; he said to himself, discontentedly. &ldquo;Madame
      Danville in the same place on the seat; my master, the bridegroom,
      dutifully next to her; Mademoiselle Rose, the bride, bashfully next to
      him; Monsieur Trudaine, the amateur apothecary brother, affectionately
      next to her; and Monsieur Lomaque, our queer land-steward, officially in
      waiting on the whole party. There they all are indeed, incomprehensibly
      wasting their time still in looking at nothing! Yes,&rdquo; continued Monsieur
      Justin, lifting his eyes wearily, and staring hard, first up the river at
      Rouen, then down the river at the setting sun; &ldquo;yes, plague take them!
      looking at nothing, absolutely and positively at nothing, all this while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Monsieur Justin yawned again, and, returning to the garden, sat
      himself down in an arbor and resignedly went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the valet had ventured near the five persons whom he had been
      apostrophizing from a distance, and if he had been possessed of some
      little refinement of observation, he could hardly have failed to remark
      that the bride and bridegroom of the morrow, and their companions on
      either side, were all, in a greater or less degree, under the influence of
      some secret restraint, which affected their conversation, their gestures,
      and even the expression of their faces. Madame Danville&mdash;a handsome,
      richly-dressed old lady, with very bright eyes, and a quick, suspicious
      manner&mdash;looked composedly and happily enough, as long as her
      attention was fixed on her son. But when she turned from him toward the
      bride, a hardly perceptible uneasiness passed over her face&mdash;an
      uneasiness which only deepened to positive distrust and dissatisfaction
      whenever she looked toward Mademoiselle Trudaine&rsquo;s brother. In the same
      way, her son, who was all smiles and happiness while he was speaking with
      his future wife, altered visibly in manner and look exactly as his mother
      altered, whenever the presence of Monsieur Trudaine specially impressed
      itself on his attention. Then, again, Lomaque, the land-steward&mdash;quiet,
      sharp, skinny Lomaque, with the submissive manner, and the red-rimmed eyes&mdash;never
      looked up at his master&rsquo;s future brother-in-law without looking away again
      rather uneasily, and thoughtfully drilling holes in the grass with his
      long sharp-pointed cane. Even the bride herself&mdash;the pretty, innocent
      girl, with her childish shyness of manner&mdash;seemed to be affected like
      the others. Doubt, if not distress, overshadowed her face from time to
      time, and the hand which her lover held trembled a little, and grew
      restless, when she accidentally caught her brother&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough there was nothing to repel, but, on the contrary,
      everything to attract in the look and manner of the person whose mere
      presence seemed to exercise such a curiously constraining influence over
      the wedding-party. Louis Trudaine was a remarkably handsome man. His
      expression was singularly kind and gentle; his manner irresistibly winning
      in its frank, manly firmness and composure. His words, when he
      occasionally spoke, seemed as unlikely to give offense as his looks; for
      he only opened his lips in courteous reply to questions directly addressed
      to him. Judging by a latent mournfulness in the tones of his voice, and by
      the sorrowful tenderness which clouded his kind, earnest eyes whenever
      they rested on his sister, his thoughts were certainly not of the happy or
      the hopeful kind. But he gave them no direct expression; he intruded his
      secret sadness, whatever it might be, on no one of his companions.
      Nevertheless, modest and self-restrained as he was, there was evidently
      some reproving or saddening influence in his presence which affected the
      spirits of every one near him, and darkened the eve of the wedding to
      bride and bridegroom alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sun slowly sank in the heavens, the conversation flagged more and
      more. After a long silence, the bridegroom was the first to start a new
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, love,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that magnificent sunset is a good omen for our
      marriage; it promises another lovely day to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bride laughed and blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really believe in omens, Charles?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; interposed the old lady, before her son could answer, &ldquo;if
      Charles does believe in omens, it is nothing to laugh at. You will soon
      know better, when you are his wife, than to confound him, even in the
      slightest things, with the common herd of people. All his convictions are
      well founded&mdash;so well, that if I thought he really did believe in
      omens, I should most assuredly make up my mind to believe in them too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, madame,&rdquo; Rose began, tremulously, &ldquo;I only meant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, have you so little knowledge of the world as to suppose
      that I could be offended&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Rose speak,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round petulantly, almost with the air of a spoiled child, to his
      mother, as he said those words. She had been looking fondly and proudly on
      him the moment before. Now her eyes wandered disconcertedly from his face;
      she hesitated an instant with a sudden confusion which seemed quite
      foreign to her character, then whispered in his ear,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to blame, Charles, for trying to make her worthy of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her son took no notice of the question. He only reiterated sharply, &ldquo;Let
      Rose speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really had nothing to say,&rdquo; faltered the young girl, growing more and
      more confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you had!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was such an ungracious sharpness in his voice, such an outburst of
      petulance in his manner as he spoke, that his mother gave him a warning
      touch on the arm, and whispered &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Lomaque, the land-steward, and Monsieur Trudaine, the brother,
      both glanced searchingly at the bride, as the words passed the
      bridegroom&rsquo;s lips. She seemed to be frightened and astonished, rather than
      irritated or hurt. A curious smile puckered up Lomaque&rsquo;s lean face, as he
      looked demurely down on the ground, and began drilling a fresh hole in the
      turf with the sharp point of his cane. Trudaine turned aside quickly, and,
      sighing, walked away a few paces; then came back, and seemed about to
      speak, but Danville interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Rose,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am so jealous of even the appearance of any
      want of attention toward you, that I was nearly allowing myself to be
      irritated about nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her hand very gracefully and tenderly as he made his excuse; but
      there was a latent expression in his eye which was at variance with the
      apparent spirit of his action. It was noticed by nobody but observant and
      submissive Monsieur Lomaque, who smiled to himself again, and drilled
      harder than ever at his hole in the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Monsieur Trudaine was about to speak,&rdquo; said Madame Danville.
      &ldquo;Perhaps he will have no objection to let us hear what he was going to
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, madame,&rdquo; replied Trudaine, politely. &ldquo;I was about to take upon
      myself the blame of Rose&rsquo;s want of respect for believers in omens, by
      confessing that I have always encouraged her to laugh at superstitions of
      every kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a ridiculer of superstitions?&rdquo; said Danville, turning quickly on him.
      &ldquo;You, who have built a laboratory; you, who are an amateur professor of
      the occult arts of chemistry&mdash;a seeker after the Elixir of Life. On
      my word of honor, you astonish me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an ironical politeness in his voice, look, and manner as he said
      this, which his mother and his land-steward, Monsieur Lomaque, evidently
      knew how to interpret. The first touched his arm again and whispered, &ldquo;Be
      careful!&rdquo; the second suddenly grew serious, and left off drilling his hole
      in the grass. Rose neither heard the warning of Madame Danville, nor
      noticed the alteration in Lomaque. She was looking round at her brother,
      and was waiting with a bright, affectionate smile to hear his answer. He
      nodded, as if to reassure her, before he spoke again to Danville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have rather romantic ideas about experiments in chemistry,&rdquo; he said,
      quietly. &ldquo;Mine have so little connection with what you call the occult
      arts that all the world might see them, if all the world thought it worth
      while. The only Elixirs of Life that I know of are a quiet heart and a
      contented mind. Both those I found, years and years ago, when Rose and I
      first came to live together in the house yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a quiet sadness in his voice, which meant far more to his
      sister than the simple words he uttered. Her eyes filled with tears; she
      turned for a moment from her lover, and took her brother&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      talk, Louis, as if you thought you were going to lose your sister, because&mdash;&rdquo;
       Her lips began to tremble, and she stopped suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More jealous than ever of your taking her away from him!&rdquo; whispered
      Madame Danville in her son&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Hush! don&rsquo;t, for God&rsquo;s sake, take any
      notice of it,&rdquo; she added, hurriedly, as he rose from the seat and faced
      Trudaine with undisguised irritation and impatience in his manner. Before
      he could speak, the old servant Guillaume made his appearance, and
      announced that coffee was ready. Madame Danville again said &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; and
      quickly took one of his arms, while he offered the other to Rose.
      &ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; said the young girl, amazedly, &ldquo;how flushed your face is, and
      how your arm trembles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He controlled himself in a moment, smiled, and said to her: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
      guess why, Rose? I am thinking of to-morrow.&rdquo; While he was speaking, he
      passed close by the land-steward, on his way back to the house with the
      ladies. The smile returned to Monsieur Lomaque&rsquo;s lean face, and a curious
      light twinkled in his red-rimmed eyes as he began a fresh hole in the
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you go indoors, and take some coffee?&rdquo; asked Trudaine, touching the
      land-steward on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Lomaque started a little and left his cane sticking in the
      ground. &ldquo;A thousand thanks, monsieur,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;may I be allowed to
      follow you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess the beauty of the evening makes me a little unwilling to leave
      this place just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the beauties of Nature&mdash;I feel them with you, Monsieur Trudaine;
      I feel them here.&rdquo; Saying this, Lomaque laid one hand on his heart, and
      with the other pulled his stick out of the grass. He had looked as little
      at the landscape or the setting sun as Monsieur Justin himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down, side by side, on the empty bench; and then there followed
      an awkward pause. Submissive Lomaque was too discreet to forget his place,
      and venture on starting a new topic. Trudaine was preoccupied, and
      disinclined to talk. It was necessary, however, in common politeness, to
      say something. Hardly attending himself to his own words, he began with a
      commonplace phrase: &ldquo;I regret, Monsieur Lomaque, that we have not had more
      opportunities of bettering our acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel deeply indebted,&rdquo; rejoined the land-steward, &ldquo;to the admirable
      Madame Danville for having chosen me as her escort hither from her son&rsquo;s
      estate near Lyons, and having thereby procured for me the honor of this
      introduction.&rdquo; Both Monsieur Lomaque&rsquo;s red-rimmed eyes were seized with a
      sudden fit of winking, as he made this polite speech. His enemies were
      accustomed to say that, whenever he was particularly insincere, or
      particularly deceitful, he always took refuge in the weakness of his eyes,
      and so evaded the trying ordeal of being obliged to look steadily at the
      person whom he was speaking with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was pleased to hear you mention my late father&rsquo;s name, at dinner, in
      terms of high respect,&rdquo; continued Trudaine, resolutely keeping up the
      conversation. &ldquo;Did you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am indirectly indebted to your excellent father,&rdquo; answered the
      land-steward, &ldquo;for the very situation which I now hold. At a time when the
      good word of a man of substance and reputation was needed to save me from
      poverty and ruin, your father spoke that word. Since then I have, in my
      own very small way, succeeded in life, until I have risen to the honor of
      superintending the estate of Monsieur Danville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but your way of speaking of your present situation rather
      surprises me. Your father, I believe, was a merchant, just as Danville&rsquo;s
      father was a merchant; the only difference between them was that one
      failed and the other realized a large fortune. Why should you speak of
      yourself as honored by holding your present place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never heard?&rdquo; exclaimed Lomaque, with an appearance of great
      astonishment, &ldquo;or can you have heard, and forgotten, that Madame Danville
      is descended from one of the noble houses of France? Has she never told
      you, as she has often told me, that she condescended when she married her
      late husband; and that her great object in life is to get the title of her
      family (years since extinct in the male line) settled on her son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Trudaine; &ldquo;I remember to have heard something of this, and
      to have paid no great attention to it at the time, having little sympathy
      with such aspirations as you describe. You have lived many years in
      Danville&rsquo;s service, Monsieur Lomaque; have you&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated for a
      moment, then continued, looking the land-steward full in the face&mdash;&ldquo;have
      you found him a good and kind master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque&rsquo;s thin lips seemed to close instinctively at the question, as if
      he were never going to speak again. He bowed&mdash;Trudaine waited&mdash;he
      only bowed again. Trudaine waited a third time. Lomaque looked at his host
      with perfect steadiness for an instant, then his eyes began to get weak
      again. &ldquo;You seem to have some special interest,&rdquo; he quietly remarked, &ldquo;if
      I may say so without offense, in asking me that question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deal frankly, at all hazards, with every one,&rdquo; returned Trudaine; &ldquo;and
      stranger as you are, I will deal frankly with you. I acknowledge that I
      have an interest in asking that question&mdash;the dearest, the tenderest
      of all interests.&rdquo; At those last words, his voice trembled for a moment,
      but he went on firmly; &ldquo;from the beginning of my sister&rsquo;s engagement with
      Danville, I made it my duty not to conceal my own feelings; my conscience
      and my affection for Rose counseled me to be candid to the last, even
      though my candor should distress or offend others. When we first made the
      acquaintance of Madame Danville, and when I first discovered that her
      son&rsquo;s attentions to Rose were not unfavorably received, I felt astonished,
      and, though it cost me a hard effort, I did not conceal that astonishment
      from my sister&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque, who had hitherto been all attention, started here, and threw up
      his hands in amazement. &ldquo;Astonished, did I hear you say? Astonished,
      Monsieur Trudaine, that the attentions of a young gentleman, possessed of
      all the graces and accomplishments of a highly-bred Frenchman, should be
      favorably received by a young lady! Astonished that such a dancer, such a
      singer, such a talker, such a notoriously fascinating ladies&rsquo; man as
      Monsieur Danville, should, by dint of respectful assiduity, succeed in
      making some impression on the heart of Mademoiselle Rose! Oh, Monsieur
      Trudaine, venerated Monsieur Trudaine, this is almost too much to credit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque&rsquo;s eyes grew weaker than ever, and winked incessantly as he uttered
      this apostrophe. At the end, he threw up his hands again, and blinked
      inquiringly all round him, in mute appeal to universal nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, in the course of time, matters were further advanced,&rdquo; continued
      Trudaine, without paying any attention to the interruption; &ldquo;when the
      offer of marriage was made, and when I knew that Rose had in her own heart
      accepted it, I objected, and I did not conceal my objections&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; interposed Lomaque again, clasping his hands this time with a
      look of bewilderment; &ldquo;what objections, what possible objections to a man
      young and well-bred, with an immense fortune and an uncompromised
      character? I have heard of these objections; I know they have made bad
      blood; and I ask myself again and again, what can they be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows I have often tried to dismiss them from my mind as fanciful and
      absurd,&rdquo; said Trudaine, &ldquo;and I have always failed. It is impossible, in
      your presence, that I can describe in detail what my own impressions have
      been, from the first, of the master whom you serve. Let it be enough if I
      confide to you that I cannot, even now, persuade myself of the sincerity
      of his attachment to my sister, and that I feel&mdash;in spite of myself,
      in spite of my earnest desire to put the most implicit confidence in
      Rose&rsquo;s choice&mdash;a distrust of his character and temper, which now, on
      the eve of the marriage, amounts to positive terror. Long secret
      suffering, doubt, and suspense, wring this confession from me, Monsieur
      Lomaque, almost unawares, in defiance of caution, in defiance of all the
      conventionalities of society. You have lived for years under the same roof
      with this man; you have seen him in his most unguarded and private
      moments. I tempt you to betray no confidence&mdash;I only ask you if you
      can make me happy by telling me that I have been doing your master
      grievous injustice by my opinion of him? I ask you to take my hand, and
      tell me if you can, in all honor, that my sister is not risking the
      happiness of her whole life by giving herself in marriage to Danville
      to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand while he spoke. By some strange chance, Lomaque
      happened just at that moment to be looking away toward those beauties of
      Nature which he admired so greatly. &ldquo;Really, Monsieur Trudaine, really
      such an appeal from you, at such a time, amazes me.&rdquo; Having got so far, he
      stopped and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we first sat down together here, I had no thought of making this
      appeal, no idea of talking to you as I have talked,&rdquo; pursued the other.
      &ldquo;My words have escaped me, as I told you, almost unawares; you must make
      allowances for them and for me. I cannot expect others, Monsieur Lomaque,
      to appreciate and understand my feelings for Rose. We two have lived alone
      in the world together; father, mother, kindred, they all died years since,
      and left us. I am so much older than my sister that I have learned to feel
      toward her more as a father than as a brother. All my life, all my dearest
      hopes, all my highest expectations, have centered in her. I was past the
      period of my boyhood when my mother put my little child sister&rsquo;s hand in
      mine, and said to me on her death-bed: &lsquo;Louis, be all to her that I have
      been, for she has no one left to look to but you.&rsquo; Since then the loves
      and ambitions of other men have not been my loves or my ambitions. Sister
      Rose&mdash;as we all used to call her in those past days, as I love to
      call her still&mdash;Sister Rose has been the one aim, the one happiness,
      the one precious trust, the one treasured reward, of all my life. I have
      lived in this poor house, in this dull retirement, as in a paradise,
      because Sister Rose&mdash;my innocent, happy, bright-faced Eve&mdash;has
      lived here with me. Even if the husband of her choice had been the husband
      of mine, the necessity of parting with her would have been the hardest,
      the bitterest of trials. As it is, thinking what I think, dreading what I
      dread, judge what my feelings must be on the eve of her marriage; and know
      why, and with what object, I made the appeal which surprised you a moment
      since, but which cannot surprise you now. Speak if you will&mdash;I can
      say no more.&rdquo; He sighed bitterly; his head dropped on his breast, and the
      hand which he had extended to Lomaque trembled as he withdrew it and let
      it fall at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land-steward was not a man accustomed to hesitate, but he hesitated
      now. He was not usually at a loss for phrases in which to express himself,
      but he stammered at the very outset of his reply. &ldquo;Suppose I answered,&rdquo; he
      began, slowly; &ldquo;suppose I told you that you wronged him, would my
      testimony really be strong enough to shake opinions, or rather
      presumptions, which have been taking firmer and firmer hold of you for
      months and months past? Suppose, on the other hand, that my master had his
      little&rdquo; (Lomaque hesitated before he pronounced the next word)&mdash;&ldquo;his
      little&mdash;infirmities, let me say; but only hypothetically, mind that&mdash;infirmities;
      and suppose I had observed them, and was willing to confide them to you,
      what purpose would such a confidence answer now, at the eleventh hour,
      with Mademoiselle Rose&rsquo;s heart engaged, with the marriage fixed for
      to-morrow? No! no! trust me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine looked up suddenly. &ldquo;I thank you for reminding me, Monsieur
      Lomaque, that it is too late now to make inquiries, and by consequence too
      late also to trust in others. My sister has chosen; and on the subject of
      that choice my lips shall be henceforth sealed. The events of the future
      are with God; whatever they may be, I hope I am strong enough to bear my
      part in them with the patience and the courage of a man! I apologize,
      Monsieur Lomaque, for having thoughtlessly embarrassed you by questions
      which I had no right to ask. Let us return to the house&mdash;I will show
      you the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque&rsquo;s lips opened, then closed again; he bowed uneasily, and his
      sallow complexion whitened for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine led the way in silence back to the house; the land-steward
      following slowly at a distance of several paces, and talking in whispers
      to himself. &ldquo;His father was the saving of me,&rdquo; muttered Lomaque; &ldquo;that is
      truth, and there is no getting over it; his father was the saving of me;
      and yet here am I&mdash;no! it&rsquo;s too late!&mdash;too late to speak&mdash;too
      late to act&mdash;too late to do anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Close to the house they were met by the old servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young lady has just sent me to call you in to coffee, monsieur,&rdquo; said
      Guillaume. &ldquo;She has kept a cup hot for you, and another cup for Monsieur
      Lomaque.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The land-steward started&mdash;this time with genuine astonishment. &ldquo;For
      me!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Rose has troubled herself to keep a cup
      of coffee hot for me?&rdquo; The old servant stared; Trudaine stopped and looked
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there so very surprising,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;in such an ordinary act of
      politeness on my sister&rsquo;s part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Monsieur Trudaine,&rdquo; answered Lomaque; &ldquo;you have not passed
      such an existence as mine&mdash;you are not a friendless old man&mdash;you
      have a settled position in the world, and are used to be treated with
      consideration. I am not. This is the first occasion in my life on which I
      find myself an object for the attention of a young lady, and it takes me
      by surprise. I repeat my excuses; pray let us go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine made no reply to this curious explanation. He wondered at it a
      little, however, and he wondered still more when, on entering the
      drawing-room, he saw Lomaque walk straight up to his sister, and&mdash;apparently
      not noticing that Danville was sitting at the harpsichord and singing at
      the time&mdash;address her confusedly and earnestly with a set speech of
      thanks for his hot cup of coffee. Rose looked perplexed, and half inclined
      to laugh, as she listened to him. Madame Danville, who sat by her side,
      frowned, and tapped the land-steward contemptuously on the arm with her
      fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be so good as to keep silent until my son has done singing,&rdquo; she said.
      Lomaque made a low bow, and retiring to a table in a corner, took up a
      newspaper lying on it. If Madame Danville had seen the expression that
      came over his face when he turned away from her, proud as she was, her
      aristocratic composure might possibly have been a little ruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danville had finished his song, had quitted the harpsichord, and was
      talking in whispers to his bride; Madame Danville was adding a word to the
      conversation every now and then; Trudaine was seated apart at the far end
      of the room, thoughtfully reading a letter which he had taken from his
      pocket, when an exclamation from Lomaque, who was still engaged with the
      newspaper, caused all the other occupants of the apartment to suspend
      their employments and look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Danville, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I be interrupting if I explain?&rdquo; inquired Lomaque, getting very
      weak in the eyes again, as he deferentially addressed himself to Madame
      Danville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have already interrupted us,&rdquo; said the old lady, sharply; &ldquo;so you may
      now just as well explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a passage from the <i>Scientific Intelligence</i> which has given
      me great delight, and which will be joyful news for every one here.&rdquo;
       Saying this, Lomaque looked significantly at Trudaine, and then read from
      the newspaper these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, PARIS.&mdash;The vacant sub-professorship of
      chemistry has been offered, we are rejoiced to hear, to a gentleman whose
      modesty has hitherto prevented his scientific merits from becoming
      sufficiently prominent in the world. To the members of the academy he has
      been long since known as the originator of some of the most remarkable
      improvements in chemistry which have been made of late years&mdash;improvements,
      the credit of which he has, with rare, and we were almost about to add,
      culpable moderation, allowed others to profit by with impunity. No man in
      any profession is more thoroughly entitled to have a position of trust and
      distinction conferred on him by the State than the gentleman to whom we
      refer&mdash;M. Louis Trudaine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Lomaque could look up from the paper to observe the impression
      which his news produced, Rose had gained her brother&rsquo;s side and was
      kissing him in a flutter of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Louis,&rdquo; she cried, clapping her hands, &ldquo;let me be the first to
      congratulate you! How proud and glad I am! You accept the professorship,
      of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine, who had hastily and confusedly put his letter back in his pocket
      the moment Lomaque began to read, seemed at a loss for an answer. He
      patted his sister&rsquo;s hand rather absently, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not made up my mind; don&rsquo;t ask me why, Rose&mdash;at least not
      now, not just now.&rdquo; An expression of perplexity and distress came over his
      face, as he gently motioned her to resume her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, is a sub-professor of chemistry supposed to hold the rank of a
      gentleman?&rdquo; asked Madame Danville, without the slightest appearance of any
      special interest in Lomaque&rsquo;s news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; replied her son, with a sarcastic laugh; &ldquo;he is expected
      to work and make himself useful. What gentleman does that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles!&rdquo; exclaimed the old lady, reddening with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried Danville, turning his back on her, &ldquo;enough of chemistry.
      Lomaque, now you have begun reading the newspaper, try if you can&rsquo;t find
      something interesting to read about. What are the last accounts from
      Paris? Any more symptoms of a general revolt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque turned to another part of the paper. &ldquo;Bad, very bad prospects for
      the restoration of tranquillity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Necker, the people&rsquo;s Minister,
      is dismissed. Placards against popular gatherings are posted all over
      Paris. The Swiss Guards have been ordered to the Champs Elysees, with four
      pieces of artillery. No more is yet known, but the worst is dreaded. The
      breach between the aristocracy and the people is widening fatally almost
      hour by hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he stopped and laid down the newspaper. Trudaine took it from him,
      and shook his head forebodingly as he looked over the paragraph which had
      just been read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried Madame Danville. &ldquo;The People, indeed! Let those four pieces
      of artillery be properly loaded, let the Swiss Guards do their duty, and
      we shall hear no more of the People!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you not to be sure of that,&rdquo; said her son, carelessly; &ldquo;there
      are rather too many people in Paris for the Swiss Guards to shoot
      conveniently. Don&rsquo;t hold your head too aristocratically high, mother, till
      we are quite certain which way the wind really does blow. Who knows if I
      may not have to bow just as low one of these days to King Mob as ever you
      courtesied in your youth to King Louis the Fifteenth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed complacently as he ended, and opened his snuff-box. His mother
      rose from her chair, her face crimson with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear you talk so&mdash;it shocks, it horrifies me!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, with vehement gesticulation. &ldquo;No, no! I decline to hear another
      word. I decline to sit by patiently while my son, whom I love, jests at
      the most sacred principles, and sneers at the memory of an anointed king.
      This is my reward, is it, for having yielded and having come here, against
      all the laws of etiquette, the night before the marriage? I comply no
      longer; I resume my own will and my own way. I order you, my son, to
      accompany me back to Rouen. We are the bridegroom&rsquo;s party, and we have no
      business overnight at the house of the bride. You meet no more till you
      meet at the church. Justin, my coach! Lomaque, pick up my hood. Monsieur
      Trudaine, thanks for your hospitality; I shall hope to return it with
      interest the first time you are in our neighborhood. Mademoiselle, put on
      your best looks to-morrow, along with your wedding finery; remember that
      my son&rsquo;s bride must do honor to my son&rsquo;s taste. Justin! my coach&mdash;drone,
      vagabond, idiot, where is my coach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother looks handsome when she is in a passion, does she not, Rose?&rdquo;
       said Danville, quietly putting up his snuff-box as the old lady sailed out
      of the room. &ldquo;Why, you seem quite frightened, love,&rdquo; he added, taking her
      hand with his easy, graceful air; &ldquo;frightened, let me assure you, without
      the least cause. My mother has but that one prejudice, and that one weak
      point, Rose. You will find her a very dove for gentleness, as long as you
      do not wound her pride of caste. Come, come, on this night, of all others,
      you must not send me away with such a face as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent down and whispered to her a bridegroom&rsquo;s compliment, which brought
      the blood back to her cheek in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how she loves him&mdash;how dearly she loves him!&rdquo; thought her
      brother, watching her from his solitary corner of the room, and seeing the
      smile that brightened her blushing face when Danville kissed her hand at
      parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque, who had remained imperturbably cool during the outbreak of the
      old lady&rsquo;s anger&mdash;Lomaque, whose observant eyes had watched
      sarcastically the effect of the scene between mother and son on Trudaine
      and his sister, was the last to take leave. After he had bowed to Rose
      with a certain gentleness in his manner, which contrasted strangely with
      his wrinkled, haggard face, he held out his hand to her brother &ldquo;I did not
      take your hand when we sat together on the bench,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;may I take it
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine met his advance courteously, but in silence. &ldquo;You may alter your
      opinion of me one of these days.&rdquo; Adding those words in a whisper,
      Monsieur Lomaque bowed once more to the bride and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes after the door had closed the brother and sister kept
      silence. &ldquo;Our last night together at home!&rdquo; That was the thought which now
      filled the heart of each. Rose was the first to speak. Hesitating a little
      as she approached her brother, she said to him, anxiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for what happened with Madame Danville, Louis. Does it make
      you think the worse of Charles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make allowance for Madame Danville&rsquo;s anger,&rdquo; returned Trudaine,
      evasively, &ldquo;because she spoke from honest conviction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest?&rdquo; echoed Rose, sadly, &ldquo;honest?&mdash;ah, Louis! I know you are
      thinking disparagingly of Charles&rsquo;s convictions, when you speak so of his
      mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine smiled and shook his head; but she took no notice of the gesture
      of denial&mdash;only stood looking earnestly and wistfully into his face.
      Her eyes began to fill; she suddenly threw her arms round his neck, and
      whispered to him: &ldquo;Oh, Louis, Louis! how I wish I could teach you to see
      Charles with my eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt her tears on his cheek as she spoke, and tried to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall teach me, Rose&mdash;you shall, indeed. Come, come, we must
      keep up our spirits, or how are you to look your best to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unclasped her arms, and led her gently to a chair. At the same moment
      there was a knock at the door, and Rose&rsquo;s maid appeared, anxious to
      consult her mistress on some of the preparations for the wedding ceremony.
      No interruption could have been more welcome just at that time. It obliged
      Rose to think of present trifles, and it gave her brother an excuse for
      retiring to his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down by his desk, doubting and heavy-hearted, and placed the letter
      from the Academy of Sciences open before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing over all the complimentary expressions which it contained, his eye
      rested only on these lines at the end: &ldquo;During the first three years of
      your professorship, you will be required to reside in or near Paris nine
      months out of the year, for the purpose of delivering lectures and
      superintending experiments from time to time in the laboratories.&rdquo; The
      letter in which these lines occurred offered him such a position as in his
      modest self-distrust he had never dreamed of before; the lines themselves
      contained the promise of such vast facilities for carrying on his favorite
      experiments as he could never hope to command in his own little study,
      with his own limited means; and yet, there he now sat doubting whether he
      should accept or reject the tempting honors and advantages that were
      offered to him&mdash;doubting for his sister&rsquo;s sake!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine months of the year in Paris,&rdquo; he said to himself, sadly; &ldquo;and Rose
      is to pass her married life at Lyons. Oh, if I could clear my heart of its
      dread on her account&mdash;if I could free my mind of its forebodings for
      her future&mdash;how gladly I would answer this letter by accepting the
      trust it offers me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a few minutes, and reflected. The thoughts that were in him
      marked their ominous course in the growing paleness of his cheek, in the
      dimness that stole over his eyes. &ldquo;If this cleaving distrust from which I
      cannot free myself should be in very truth the mute prophecy of evil to
      come&mdash;to come, I know not when&mdash;if it be so (which God forbid!),
      how soon she may want a friend, a protector near at hand, a ready refuge
      in the time of her trouble! Where shall she then find protection or
      refuge? With that passionate woman? With her husband&rsquo;s kindred and
      friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered as the thought crossed his mind, and opening a blank sheet of
      paper, dipped his pen in the ink. &ldquo;Be all to her, Louis, that I have
      been,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, repeating his mother&rsquo;s last words, and
      beginning the letter while he uttered them. It was soon completed. It
      expressed in the most respectful terms his gratitude for the offer made to
      him, and his inability to accept it, in consequence of domestic
      circumstances which it was needless to explain. The letter was directed,
      sealed; it only remained for him to place it in the post-bag, lying near
      at hand. At this last decisive act he hesitated. He had told Lomaque, and
      he had firmly believed himself, that he had conquered all ambitions for
      his sister&rsquo;s sake. He knew now, for the first time, that he had only
      lulled them to rest&mdash;he knew that the letter from Paris had aroused
      them. His answer was written, his hand was on the post-bag, and at that
      moment the whole struggle had to be risked over again&mdash;risked when he
      was most unfit for it! He was not a man under any ordinary circumstances
      to procrastinate, but he procrastinated now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Night brings counsel; I will wait till to-morrow,&rdquo; he said to himself,
      and put the letter of refusal in his pocket, and hastily quitted the
      laboratory.

      Inexorably the important morrow came: irretrievably, for good or for evil,
      the momentous marriage-vow was pronounced. Charles Danville and Rose
      Trudaine were now man and wife. The prophecy of the magnificent sunset
      overnight had not proved false. It was a cloudless day on the marriage
      morning. The nuptial ceremonies had proceeded smoothly throughout, and had
      even satisfied Madame Danville. She returned with the wedding-party to
      Trudaine&rsquo;s house, all smiles and serenity. To the bride she was
      graciousness itself. &ldquo;Good girl,&rdquo; said the old lady, following Rose into a
      corner, and patting her approvingly on the cheek with her fan; &ldquo;good girl,
      you have looked well this morning&mdash;you have done credit to my son&rsquo;s
      taste. Indeed, you have pleased me, child! Now go upstairs, and get on
      your traveling-dress, and count on my maternal affection as long as you
      make Charles happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had been arranged that the bride and bridegroom should pass their
      honeymoon in Brittany, and then return to Danville&rsquo;s estate near Lyons.
      The parting was hurried over, as all such partings should be. The carriage
      had driven off; Trudaine, after lingering long to look after it, had
      returned hastily to the house; the very dust of the whirling wheels had
      all dispersed; there was absolutely nothing to see; and yet there stood
      Monsieur Lomaque at the outer gate; idly, as if he was an independent man&mdash;calmly,
      as if no such responsibilities as the calling of Madame Danville&rsquo;s coach,
      and the escorting of Madame Danville back to Lyons, could possibly rest on
      his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Idly and calmly, slowly rubbing his hands one over the other, slowly
      nodding his head in the direction by which the bride and bridegroom had
      departed, stood the eccentric land-steward at the outer gate. On a sudden
      the sound of footsteps approaching from the house seemed to arouse him.
      Once more he looked out into the road, as if he expected still to see the
      carriage of the newly-married couple. &ldquo;Poor girl! ah, poor girl!&rdquo; said
      Monsieur Lomaque softly to himself, turning round to ascertain who was
      coming from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only the postman with a letter in his hand, and the post-bag
      crumpled up under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any fresh news from Paris, friend?&rdquo; asked Lomaque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very bad, monsieur,&rdquo; answered the postman. &ldquo;Camille Desmoulins has
      appealed to the people in the Palais Royal; there are fears of a riot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a riot!&rdquo; repeated Lomaque, sarcastically. &ldquo;Oh, what a brave
      Government not to be afraid of anything worse! Any letters?&rdquo; he added,
      hastily dropping the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None <i>to</i> the house,&rdquo; said the postman, &ldquo;only one <i>from</i> it,
      given me by Monsieur Trudaine. Hardly worth while,&rdquo; he added, twirling the
      letter in his hand, &ldquo;to put it into the bag, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque looked over his shoulder as he spoke, and saw that the letter was
      directed to the President of the Academy of Sciences, Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether he accepts the place or refuses it?&rdquo; thought the
      land-steward, nodding to the postman, and continuing on his way back to
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door he met Trudaine, who said to him, rather hastily, &ldquo;You are
      going back to Lyons with Madame Danville, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very day,&rdquo; answered Lomaque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you should hear of a convenient bachelor lodging, at Lyons, or near
      it,&rdquo; continued the other, dropping his voice and speaking more rapidly
      than before, &ldquo;you would be doing me a favor if you would let me know about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque assented; but before he could add a question which was on the tip
      of his tongue, Trudaine had vanished in the interior of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bachelor lodging!&rdquo; repeated the land-steward, standing alone on the
      doorstep. &ldquo;At or near Lyons! Aha! Monsieur Trudaine, I put your bachelor
      lodging and your talk to me last night together, and I make out a sum
      total which is, I think, pretty near the mark. You have refused that Paris
      appointment, my friend; and I fancy I can guess why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused thoughtfully, and shook his head with ominous frowns and bitings
      of his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All clear enough in that sky,&rdquo; he continued, after a while, looking up at
      the lustrous midday heaven. &ldquo;All clear enough there; but I think I see a
      little cloud rising in a certain household firmament already&mdash;a
      little cloud which hides much, and which I for one shall watch carefully.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Five years have elapsed since Monsieur Lomaque stood thoughtfully at the
      gate of Trudaine&rsquo;s house, looking after the carriage of the bride and
      bridegroom, and seriously reflecting on the events of the future. Great
      changes have passed over that domestic firmament in which he prophetically
      discerned the little warning cloud. Greater changes have passed over the
      firmament of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was revolt five years ago is Revolution now&mdash;revolution which
      has ingulfed thrones, and principalities, and powers; which has set up
      crownless, inhereditary kings and counselors of its own, and has bloodily
      torn them down again by dozens; which has raged and raged on
      unrestrainedly in fierce earnest, until but one king can still govern and
      control it for a little while. That king is named Terror, and seventeen
      hundred and ninety-four is the year of his reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Lomaque, land-steward no longer, sits alone in an
      official-looking room in one of the official buildings of Paris. It is
      another July evening, as fine as that evening when he and Trudaine sat
      talking together on the bench overlooking the Seine. The window of the
      room is wide open, and a faint, pleasant breeze is beginning to flow
      through it. But Lomaque breathes uneasily, as if still oppressed by the
      sultry midday heat; and there are signs of perplexity and trouble in his
      face as he looks down absently now and then into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The times he lives in are enough of themselves to sadden any man&rsquo;s face.
      In the Reign of Terror no living being in all the city of Paris can rise
      in the morning and be certain of escaping the spy, the denunciation, the
      arrest, or the guillotine, before night. Such times are trying enough to
      oppress any man&rsquo;s spirits; but Lomaque is not thinking of them or caring
      for them now. Out of a mass of papers which lie before him on his old
      writing-table, he has just taken up and read one, which has carried his
      thoughts back to the past, and to the changes which have taken place since
      he stood alone on the doorstep of Trudaine&rsquo;s house, pondering on what
      might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      More rapidly even than he had foreboded those changes had occurred. In
      less time even than he had anticipated, the sad emergency for which Rose&rsquo;s
      brother had prepared, as for a barely possible calamity, overtook
      Trudaine, and called for all the patience, the courage, the self-sacrifice
      which he had to give for his sister&rsquo;s sake. By slow gradations downward,
      from bad to worse, her husband&rsquo;s character manifested itself less and less
      disguisedly almost day by day. Occasional slights, ending in habitual
      neglect; careless estrangement, turning to cool enmity; small insults,
      which ripened evilly to great injuries&mdash;these were the pitiless signs
      which showed her that she had risked all and lost all while still a young
      woman&mdash;these were the unmerited afflictions which found her helpless,
      and would have left her helpless, but for the ever-present comfort and
      support of her brother&rsquo;s self-denying love. From the first, Trudaine had
      devoted himself to meet such trials as now assailed him; and like a man he
      met them, in defiance alike of persecution from the mother and of insult
      from the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard task was only lightened when, as time advanced, public trouble
      began to mingle itself with private grief. Then absorbing political
      necessities came as a relief to domestic misery. Then it grew to be the
      one purpose and pursuit of Danville&rsquo;s life cunningly to shape his course
      so that he might move safely onward with the advancing revolutionary tide&mdash;he
      cared not whither, as long as he kept his possessions safe and his life
      out of danger. His mother, inflexibly true to her Old-World convictions
      through all peril, might entreat and upbraid, might talk of honor, and
      courage, and sincerity&mdash;he heeded her not, or heeded only to laugh.
      As he had taken the false way with his wife, so he was now bent on taking
      it with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The years passed on; destroying changes swept hurricane-like over the old
      governing system of France; and still Danville shifted successfully with
      the shifting times. The first days of the Terror approached; in public and
      in private&mdash;in high places and in low&mdash;each man now suspected
      his brother. Crafty as Danville was, even he fell under suspicion at last,
      at headquarters in Paris, principally on his mother&rsquo;s account. This was
      his first political failure; and, in a moment of thoughtless rage and
      disappointment, he wreaked the irritation caused by it on Lomaque.
      Suspected himself, he in turn suspected the land-steward. His mother
      fomented the suspicion&mdash;Lomaque was dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the old times the victim would have been ruined, in the new times he
      was simply rendered eligible for a political vocation in life. Lomaque was
      poor, quick-witted, secret, not scrupulous. He was a good patriot; he had
      good patriot friends, plenty of ambition, a subtle, cat-like courage,
      nothing to dread&mdash;and he went to Paris. There were plenty of small
      chances there for men of his caliber. He waited for one of them. It came;
      he made the most of it; attracted favorably the notice of the terrible
      Fouquier-Tinville; and won his way to a place in the office of the Secret
      Police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Danville&rsquo;s anger cooled down; he recovered the use of that
      cunning sense which had hitherto served him well, and sent to recall the
      discarded servant. It was too late. Lomaque was already in a position to
      set him at defiance&mdash;nay, to put his neck, perhaps, under the blade
      of the guillotine. Worse than this, anonymous letters reached him, warning
      him to lose no time in proving his patriotism by some indisputable
      sacrifice, and in silencing his mother, whose imprudent sincerity was
      likely ere long to cost her her life. Danville knew her well enough to
      know that there was but one way of saving her, and thereby saving himself.
      She had always refused to emigrate; but he now insisted that she should
      seize the first opportunity he could procure for her of quitting France
      until calmer times arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably she would have risked her own life ten times over rather than
      have obeyed him; but she had not the courage to risk her son&rsquo;s too; and
      she yielded for his sake. Partly by secret influence, partly by unblushing
      fraud, Danville procured for her such papers and permits as would enable
      her to leave France by way of Marseilles. Even then she refused to depart,
      until she knew what her son&rsquo;s plans were for the future. He showed her a
      letter which he was about to dispatch to Robespierre himself, vindicating
      his suspected patriotism, and indignantly demanding to be allowed to prove
      it by filling some office, no matter how small, under the redoubtable
      triumvirate which then governed, or more properly terrified, France. The
      sight of this document reassured Madame Danville. She bade her son
      farewell, and departed at last, with one trusty servant, for Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danville&rsquo;s intention, in sending his letter to Paris, had been simply to
      save himself by patriotic bluster. He was thunderstruck at receiving a
      reply, taking him at his word, and summoning him to the capital to accept
      employment there under the then existing Government. There was no choice
      but to obey. So to Paris he journeyed, taking his wife with him into the
      very jaws of danger. He was then at open enmity with Trudaine; and the
      more anxious and alarmed he could make the brother feel on the sister&rsquo;s
      account, the better he was pleased. True to his trust and his love,
      through all dangers as through all persecutions, Trudaine followed them;
      and the street of their sojourn at Paris, in the perilous days of the
      Terror, was the street of his sojourn too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danville had been astonished at the acceptance of his proffered services;
      he was still more amazed when he found that the post selected for him was
      one of the superintendent&rsquo;s places in that very office of Secret Police in
      which Lomaque was employed as agent. Robespierre and his colleagues had
      taken the measure of their man&mdash;he had money enough, and local
      importance enough to be worth studying. They knew where he was to be
      distrusted, and how he might be made useful. The affairs of the Secret
      Police were the sort of affairs which an unscrupulously cunning man was
      fitted to help on; and the faithful exercise of that cunning in the
      service of the State was insured by the presence of Lomaque in the office.
      The discarded servant was just the right sort of spy to watch the
      suspected master. Thus it happened that, in the office of the Secret
      Police at Paris, and under the Reign of Terror, Lomaque&rsquo;s old master was,
      nominally, his master still&mdash;the superintendent to whom he was
      ceremonially accountable, in public&mdash;the suspected man, whose
      slightest words and deeds he was officially set to watch, in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever sadder and darker grew the face of Lomaque as he now pondered alone
      over the changes and misfortunes of the past five years. A neighboring
      church-clock striking the hour of seven aroused him from his meditations.
      He arranged the confused mass of papers before him&mdash;looked toward the
      door, as if expecting some one to enter&mdash;then, finding himself still
      alone, recurred to the one special paper which had first suggested his
      long train of gloomy thoughts. The few lines it contained were signed in
      cipher, and ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are aware that your superintendent, Danville, obtained leave of
      absence last week to attend to some affairs of his at Lyons, and that he
      is not expected back just yet for a day or two. While he is away, push on
      the affair of Trudaine. Collect all the evidence, and hold yourself in
      readiness to act on it at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Don&rsquo;t leave the office till
      you have heard from me again. If you have a copy of the Private
      Instructions respecting Danville, which you wrote for me, send it to my
      house. I wish to refresh my memory. Your original letter is burned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the note abruptly terminated. As he folded it up and put it in his
      pocket, Lomaque sighed. This was a very rare expression of feeling with
      him. He leaned back in his chair, and beat his nails impatiently on the
      table. Suddenly there was a faint little tap at the room door, and eight
      or ten men&mdash;evidently familiars of the new French Inquisition&mdash;quietly
      entered, and ranged themselves against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque nodded to two of them. &ldquo;Picard and Magloire, go and sit down at
      that desk. I shall want you after the rest are gone.&rdquo; Saying this, Lomaque
      handed certain sealed and docketed papers to the other men waiting in the
      room, who received them in silence, bowed, and went out. Innocent
      spectators might have thought them clerks taking bills of lading from a
      merchant. Who could have imagined that the giving and receiving of
      Denunciations, Arrest-orders, and Death-warrants&mdash;the providing of
      its doomed human meal for the all-devouring guillotine&mdash;could have
      been managed so coolly and quietly, with such unruffled calmness of
      official routine?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Lomaque, turning to the two men at the desk, as the door
      closed, &ldquo;have you got those notes about you?&rdquo; (They answered in the
      affirmative.) &ldquo;Picard, you have the first particulars of this affair of
      Trudaine; so you must begin reading. I have sent in the reports; but we
      may as well go over the evidence again from the commencement, to make sure
      that nothing has been left out. If any corrections are to be made, now is
      the time to make them. Read, Picard, and lose as little time as you
      possibly can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus admonished, Picard drew some long slips of paper from his pocket, and
      began reading from them as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minutes of evidence collected concerning Louis Trudaine, suspected, on
      the denunciation of Citizen Superintendent Danville, of hostility to the
      sacred cause of liberty, and of disaffection to the sovereignty of the
      people. (1.) The suspected person is placed under secret observation, and
      these facts are elicited: He is twice seen passing at night from his own
      house to a house in the Rue de Clery. On the first night he carries with
      him money&mdash;on the second, papers. He returns without either. These
      particulars have been obtained through a citizen engaged to help Trudaine
      in housekeeping (one of the sort called Servants in the days of the
      Tyrants). This man is a good patriot, who can be trusted to watch
      Trudaine&rsquo;s actions. (2.) The inmates of the house in the Rue de Clery are
      numerous, and in some cases not so well known to the Government as could
      be wished. It is found difficult to gain certain information about the
      person or persons visited by Trudaine without having recourse to an
      arrest. (3.) An arrest is thought premature at this preliminary stage of
      the proceedings, being likely to stop the development of conspiracy, and
      give warning to the guilty to fly. Order thereupon given to watch and wait
      for the present. (4.) Citizen Superintendent Danville quits Paris for a
      short time. The office of watching Trudaine is then taken out of the hands
      of the undersigned, and is confided to his comrade, Magloire.&mdash;Signed,
      PICARD. Countersigned, LOMAQUE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having read so far, the police agent placed his papers on the
      writing-table, waited a moment for orders, and, receiving none, went out.
      No change came over the sadness and perplexity of Lomaque&rsquo;s face. He still
      beat his nails anxiously on the writing-table, and did not even look at
      the second agent as he ordered the man to read his report. Magloire
      produced some slips of paper precisely similar to Picard&rsquo;s and read from
      them in the same rapid, business-like, unmodulated tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Affair of Trudaine. Minutes continued. Citizen Agent Magloire having been
      appointed to continue the surveillance of Trudaine, reports the discovery
      of additional facts of importance. (1.) Appearances make it probable that
      Trudaine meditates a third secret visit to the house in the Rue de Clery.
      The proper measures are taken for observing him closely, and the result is
      the implication of another person discovered to be connected with the
      supposed conspiracy. This person is the sister of Trudaine, and the wife
      of Citizen Superintendent Danville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor, lost creature! ah, poor, lost creature!&rdquo; muttered Lomaque to
      himself, sighing again, and shifting uneasily from side to side, in his
      mangy old leathern armchair. Apparently, Magloire was not accustomed to
      sighs, interruptions, and expressions of regret from the usually
      imperturbable chief agent. He looked up from his papers with a stare of
      wonder. &ldquo;Go on, Magloire!&rdquo; cried Lomaque, with a sudden outburst of
      irritability. &ldquo;Why the devil don&rsquo;t you go on?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;All ready, citizen,&rdquo;
       returned Magloire, submissively, and proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;(2.) It is at Trudaine&rsquo;s house that the woman Danville&rsquo;s connection with
      her brother&rsquo;s secret designs is ascertained, through the vigilance of the
      before-mentioned patriot citizen. The interview of the two suspected
      persons is private; their conversation is carried on in whispers. Little
      can be overheard; but that little suffices to prove that Trudaine&rsquo;s sister
      is perfectly aware of his intention to proceed for the third time to the
      house in the Rue de Clery. It is further discovered that she awaits his
      return, and that she then goes back privately to her own house. (3.)
      Meanwhile, the strictest measures are taken for watching the house in the
      Rue de Clery. It is discovered that Trudaine&rsquo;s visits are paid to a man
      and woman known to the landlord and lodgers by the name of Dubois. They
      live on the fourth floor. It is impossible, at the time of the discovery,
      to enter this room, or to see the citizen and citoyenne Dubois, without
      producing an undesirable disturbance in the house and neighborhood. A
      police agent is left to watch the place, while search and arrest orders
      are applied for. The granting of these is accidentally delayed. When they
      are ultimately obtained, it is discovered that the man and the woman are
      both missing. They have not hitherto been traced. (4.) The landlord of the
      house is immediately arrested, as well as the police agent appointed to
      watch the premises. The landlord protests that he knows nothing of his
      tenants. It is suspected, however, that he has been tampered with, as also
      that Trudaine&rsquo;s papers, delivered to the citizen and citoyenne Dubois, are
      forged passports. With these and with money, it may not be impossible that
      they have already succeeded in escaping from France. The proper measures
      have been taken for stopping them, if they have not yet passed the
      frontiers. No further report in relation to them has yet been received
      (5.) Trudaine and his sister are under perpetual surveillance, and the
      undersigned holds himself ready for further orders.&mdash;Signed,
      MAGLOIRE. Countersigned, LOMAQUE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having finished reading his notes, Magloire placed them on the
      writing-table. He was evidently a favored man in the office, and he
      presumed upon his position; for he ventured to make a remark, instead of
      leaving the room in silence, like his predecessor Picard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Citizen Danville returns to Paris,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;he will be rather
      astonished to find that in denouncing his wife&rsquo;s brother he had also
      unconsciously denounced his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque looked up quickly, with that old weakness in his eyes which
      affected them in such a strangely irregular manner on certain occasions.
      Magloire knew what this symptom meant, and would have become confused if
      he had not been a police agent. As it was, he quietly backed a step or two
      from the table, and held his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend Magloire,&rdquo; said Lomaque, winking mildly, &ldquo;your last remark looks
      to me like a question in disguise. I put questions constantly to others; I
      never answer questions myself. You want to know, citizen, what our
      superintendent&rsquo;s secret motive is for denouncing his wife&rsquo;s brother?
      Suppose you try and find that out for yourself. It will be famous practice
      for you, friend Magloire&mdash;famous practice after office hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any further orders?&rdquo; inquired Magloire, sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None in relation to the reports,&rdquo; returned Lomaque. &ldquo;I find nothing to
      alter or add on a revised hearing. But I shall have a little note ready
      for you immediately. Sit down at the other desk, friend Magloire; I am
      very fond of you when you are not inquisitive; pray sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While addressing this polite invitation to the agent in his softest voice,
      Lomaque produced his pocketbook, and drew from it a little note, which he
      opened and read through attentively. It was headed: &ldquo;Private Instructions
      relative to Superintendent Danville,&rdquo; and proceeded thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The undersigned can confidently assert, from long domestic experience in
      Danville&rsquo;s household that his motive for denouncing his wife&rsquo;s brother is
      purely a personal one, and is not in the most remote degree connected with
      politics. Briefly, the facts are these: Louis Trudaine, from the first,
      opposed his sister&rsquo;s marriage with Danville, distrusting the latter&rsquo;s
      temper and disposition. The marriage, however, took place, and the brother
      resigned himself to await results&mdash;taking the precaution of living in
      the same neighborhood as his sister, to interpose, if need be, between the
      crimes which the husband might commit and the sufferings which the wife
      might endure. The results soon exceeded his worst anticipations, and
      called for the interposition for which he had prepared himself. He is a
      man of inflexible firmness, patience, and integrity, and he makes the
      protection and consolation of his sister the business of his life. He
      gives his brother-in-law no pretext for openly quarreling with him. He is
      neither to be deceived, irritated, nor tired out, and he is Danville&rsquo;s
      superior every way&mdash;in conduct, temper, and capacity. Under these
      circumstances, it is unnecessary to say that his brother-in-law&rsquo;s enmity
      toward him is of the most implacable kind, and equally unnecessary to hint
      at the perfectly plain motive of the denunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the suspicious circumstances affecting not Trudaine only, but his
      sister as well, the undersigned regrets his inability, thus far, to offer
      either explanation or suggestion. At this preliminary stage, the affair
      seems involved in impenetrable mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque read these lines through, down to his own signature at the end.
      They were the duplicate Secret Instructions demanded from him in the paper
      which he had been looking over before the entrance of the two police
      agents. Slowly, and, as it seemed, unwillingly, he folded the note up in a
      fresh sheet of paper, and was preparing to seal it when a tap at the door
      stopped him. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he cried, irritably; and a man in traveling
      costume, covered with dust, entered, quietly whispered a word or two in
      his ear, and then went out. Lomaque started at the whisper, and, opening
      his note again, hastily wrote under his signature: &ldquo;I have just heard that
      Danville has hastened his return to Paris, and may be expected back
      to-night.&rdquo; Having traced these lines, he closed, sealed, and directed the
      letter, and gave it to Magloire. The police agent looked at the address as
      he left the room; it was &ldquo;To Citizen Robespierre, Rue Saint-Honore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left alone again, Lomaque rose, and walked restlessly backward and
      forward, biting his nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danville comes back to-night,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and the crisis comes
      with him. Trudaine a conspirator! Bah! conspiracy can hardly be the answer
      to the riddle this time. What is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a turn or two in silence&mdash;then stopped at the open window,
      looking out on what little glimpse the street afforded him of the sunset
      sky. &ldquo;This time five years,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Trudaine was talking to me on that
      bench overlooking the river; and Sister Rose was keeping poor
      hatchet-faced old Lomaque&rsquo;s cup of coffee hot for him! Now I am officially
      bound to suspect them both; perhaps to arrest them; perhaps&mdash;I wish
      this job had fallen into other hands. I don&rsquo;t want it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want
      it at any price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the writing-table and sat down to his papers, with the
      dogged air of a man determined to drive away vexing thoughts by dint of
      sheer hard work. For more than an hour he labored on resolutely, munching
      a bit of dry bread from time to time. Then he paused a little, and began
      to think again. Gradually the summer twilight faded, and the room grew
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we shall tide over to-night, after all&mdash;who knows?&rdquo; said
      Lomaque, ringing his handbell for lights. They were brought in, and with
      them ominously returned the police agent Magloire with a small sealed
      packet. It contained an arrest-order and a tiny three-cornered note,
      looking more like a love-letter, or a lady&rsquo;s invitation to a party, than
      anything else. Lomaque opened the note eagerly and read these lines neatly
      written, and signed with Robespierre&rsquo;s initials&mdash;M. R.&mdash;formed
      elegantly in cipher:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest Trudaine and his sister to-night. On second thoughts, I am not
      sure, if Danville comes back in time to be present, that it may not be all
      the better. He is unprepared for his wife&rsquo;s arrest. Watch him closely when
      it takes place, and report privately to me. I am afraid he is a vicious
      man; and of all things I abhor Vice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any more work for me to-night?&rdquo; asked Magloire, with a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only an arrest,&rdquo; replied Lomaque. &ldquo;Collect our men; and when you&rsquo;re ready
      get a coach at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were just going to supper,&rdquo; grumbled Magloire to himself, as he went
      out. &ldquo;The devil seize the Aristocrats! They&rsquo;re all in such a hurry to get
      to the guillotine that they won&rsquo;t even give a man time to eat his victuals
      in peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no choice now,&rdquo; muttered Lomaque, angrily thrusting the
      arrest-order and the three-cornered note into his pocket. &ldquo;His father was
      the saving of me; he himself welcomed me like an equal; his sister treated
      me like a gentleman, as the phrase went in those days; and now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and wiped his forehead&mdash;then unlocked his desk, produced a
      bottle of brandy, and poured himself out a glass of the liquor, which he
      drank by sips, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether other men get softer-hearted as they grow older!&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I seem to do so, at any rate. Courage! courage! what must be, must.
      If I risked my head to do it, I couldn&rsquo;t stop this arrest. Not a man in
      the office but would be ready to execute it, if I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the rumble of carriage-wheels sounded outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the coach!&rdquo; exclaimed Lomaque, locking up the brandy-bottle, and
      taking his hat. &ldquo;After all, as this arrest is to be made, it&rsquo;s as well for
      them that I should make it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Consoling himself as he best could with this reflection, Chief Police
      Agent Lomaque blew out the candles, and quitted the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ignorant of the change in her husband&rsquo;s plans, which was to bring him back
      to Paris a day before the time that had been fixed for his return, Sister
      Rose had left her solitary home to spend the evening with her brother.
      They had sat talking together long after sunset, and had let the darkness
      steal on them insensibly, as people will who are only occupied with quiet,
      familiar conversation. Thus it happened, by a curious coincidence, that
      just as Lomaque was blowing out his candles at the office Rose was
      lighting the reading-lamp at her brother&rsquo;s lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years of disappointment and sorrow had sadly changed her to outward
      view. Her face looked thinner and longer; the once delicate red and white
      of her complexion was gone; her figure had wasted under the influence of
      some weakness, which had already made her stoop a little when she walked.
      Her manner had lost its maiden shyness, only to become unnaturally quiet
      and subdued. Of all the charms which had so fatally, yet so innocently,
      allured her heartless husband, but one remained&mdash;the winning
      gentleness of her voice. It might be touched now and then with a note of
      sadness, but the soft attraction of its even, natural tone still remained.
      In the marring of all other harmonies, this one harmony had been preserved
      unchanged. Her brother, though his face was careworn, and his manner
      sadder than of old, looked less altered from his former self. It is the
      most fragile material which soonest shows the flaw. The world&rsquo;s idol,
      Beauty, holds its frailest tenure of existence in the one Temple where we
      most love to worship it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you think, Louis, that our perilous undertaking has really ended
      well by this time?&rdquo; said Rose, anxiously, as she lighted the lamp and
      placed the glass shade over it. &ldquo;What a relief it is only to hear you say
      you think we have succeeded at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I hope, Rose,&rdquo; replied her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, even hoped is a great word from you, Louis&mdash;a great word from
      any one in this fearful city, and in these days of Terror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped suddenly, seeing her brother raise his hand in warning. They
      looked at each other in silence and listened. The sound of footsteps going
      slowly past the house&mdash;ceasing for a moment just beyond it&mdash;then
      going on again&mdash;came through the open window. There was nothing else,
      out-of-doors or in, to disturb the silence of the night&mdash;the deadly
      silence of Terror which, for months past, had hung over Paris. It was a
      significant sign of the times, that even a passing footstep, sounding a
      little strangely at night, was subject for suspicion, both to brother and
      sister&mdash;so common a subject, that they suspended their conversation
      as a matter of course, without exchanging a word of explanation, until the
      tramp of the strange footsteps had died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louis,&rdquo; continued Rose, dropping her voice to a whisper, after nothing
      more was audible, &ldquo;when may I trust our secret to my husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; rejoined Trudaine, earnestly. &ldquo;Not a word, not a hint of it,
      till I give you leave. Remember, Rose, you promised silence from the
      first. Everything depends on your holding that promise sacred till I
      release you from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will hold it sacred; I will indeed, at all hazards, under all
      provocations,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite enough to reassure me&mdash;and now, love, let us change
      the subject. Even these walls may have ears, and the closed door yonder
      may be no protection.&rdquo; He looked toward it uneasily while he spoke.
      &ldquo;By-the-by, I have come round to your way of thinking, Rose, about that
      new servant of mine&mdash;there is something false in his face. I wish I
      had been as quick to detect it as you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose glanced at him affrightedly. &ldquo;Has he done anything suspicious? Have
      you caught him watching you? Tell me the worst, Louis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! my dear, not so loud. Don&rsquo;t alarm yourself; he has done
      nothing suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn him off&mdash;pray, pray turn him off, before it is too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And be denounced by him, in revenge, the first night he goes to his
      Section. You forget that servants and masters are equal now. I am not
      supposed to keep a servant at all. I have a citizen living with me who
      lays me under domestic obligations, for which I make a pecuniary
      acknowledgment. No! no! if I do anything, I must try if I can&rsquo;t entrap him
      into giving me warning. But we have got to another unpleasant subject
      already&mdash;suppose I change the topic again? You will find a little
      book on that table there, in the corner&mdash;tell me what you think of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The book was a copy of Corneille&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cid,&rdquo; prettily bound in blue morocco.
      Rose was enthusiastic in her praises. &ldquo;I found it in a bookseller&rsquo;s shop,
      yesterday,&rdquo; said her brother, &ldquo;and bought it as a present for you.
      Corneille is not an author to compromise any one, even in these times.
      Don&rsquo;t you remember saying the other day that you felt ashamed of knowing
      but little of our greatest dramatist?&rdquo; Rose remembered well, and smiled
      almost as happily as in the old times over her present. &ldquo;There are some
      good engravings at the beginning of each act,&rdquo; continued Trudaine,
      directing her attention rather earnestly to the illustrations, and then
      suddenly leaving her side when he saw that she became interested in
      looking at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the window&mdash;listened&mdash;then drew aside the curtain,
      and looked up and down the street. No living soul was in sight. &ldquo;I must
      have been mistaken,&rdquo; he thought, returning hastily to his sister; &ldquo;but I
      certainly fancied I was followed in my walk to-day by a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; asked Rose, still busy over her book, &ldquo;I wonder, Louis,
      whether my husband would let me go with you to see &lsquo;Le Cid&rsquo; the next time
      it is acted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried a voice at the door; &ldquo;not if you went on your knees to ask
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose turned round with a scream. There stood her husband on the threshold,
      scowling at her, with his hat on, and his hands thrust doggedly into his
      pockets. Trudaine&rsquo;s servant announced him, with an insolent smile, during
      the pause that followed the discovery. &ldquo;Citizen Superintendent Danville,
      to visit the citoyenne, his wife,&rdquo; said the fellow, making a mock bow to
      his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose looked at her brother, then advanced a few paces toward the door.
      &ldquo;This is a surprise,&rdquo; she said, faintly; &ldquo;has anything happened? We&mdash;we
      didn&rsquo;t expect you.&rdquo; Her voice failed her as she saw her husband advancing,
      pale to his very lips with suppressed anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you come here, after what I told you?&rdquo; he asked, in quick, low
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank at his voice almost as if he had struck her. The blood flew
      into her brother&rsquo;s face as he noticed the action; but he controlled
      himself, and, taking her hand, led her in silence to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you to sit down in his house,&rdquo; said Danville, advancing still;
      &ldquo;I order you to come back with me! Do you hear? I order you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was approaching nearer to her, when he caught Trudaine&rsquo;s eye fixed on
      him, and stopped. Rose started up, and placed herself between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Charles, Charles!&rdquo; she said to her husband, &ldquo;be friends with Louis
      to-night, and be kind again to me. I have a claim to ask that much of you,
      though you may not think it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away from her, and laughed contemptuously. She tried to speak
      again, but Trudaine touched her on the arm, and gave her a warning look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signals!&rdquo; exclaimed Danville; &ldquo;secret signals between you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eye, as he glanced suspiciously at his wife, fell on Trudaine&rsquo;s
      gift-book, which she still held unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What book is that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a play of Corneille&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered Rose; &ldquo;Louis has just made me a
      present of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this avowal Danville&rsquo;s suppressed anger burst beyond all control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it him back!&rdquo; he cried, in a voice of fury. &ldquo;You shall take no
      presents from him; the venom of the household spy soils everything he
      touches. Give it him back!&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t?&rdquo; He tore the book
      from her with an oath, threw it on the floor, and set his foot on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Louis! Louis! for God&rsquo;s sake, remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine was stepping forward as the book fell to the floor. At the same
      moment his sister threw her arms round him. He stopped, turning from fiery
      red to ghastly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Louis!&rdquo; she said, clasping him closer; &ldquo;not after five years&rsquo;
      patience. No&mdash;no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gently detached her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, love. Don&rsquo;t be afraid; it is all over now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying that, he put her from him, and in silence took up the book from the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t <i>that</i> offend you even?&rdquo; said Danville, with an insolent
      smile. &ldquo;You have a wonderful temper&mdash;any other man would have called
      me out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine looked back at him steadily; and taking out his handkerchief,
      passed it over the soiled cover of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could wipe the stain of your blood off my conscience as easily as I
      can wipe the stain of your boot off this book,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;you
      should not live another hour. Don&rsquo;t cry, Rose,&rdquo; he continued, turning
      again to his sister: &ldquo;I will take care of your book for you until you can
      keep it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do this! you will do that!&rdquo; cried Danville, growing more and
      more exasperated, and letting his anger got the better even of his cunning
      now. &ldquo;Talk less confidently of the future&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know what it has
      in store for you. Govern your tongue when you are in my presence; a day
      may come when you will want my help&mdash;my help; do you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine turned his face from his sister, as if he feared to let her see
      it when those words were spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who followed me to-day was a spy&mdash;Danville&rsquo;s spy!&rdquo; That
      thought flashed across his mind, but he gave it no utterance. There was an
      instant&rsquo;s pause of silence; and through it there came heavily on the still
      night air the rumbling of distant wheels. The sound advanced nearer and
      nearer&mdash;advanced and ceased under the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danville hurried to it, and looked out eagerly. &ldquo;I have not hastened my
      return without reason. I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed this arrest for anything!&rdquo;
       thought he, peering into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars were out, but there was no moon. He could not recognize either
      the coach or the persons who got out of it, and he turned again into the
      interior of the room. His wife had sunk into a chair, her brother was
      locking up in a cabinet the book which he had promised to take care of for
      her. The dead silence made the noise of slowly ascending footsteps on the
      stairs painfully audible. At last the door opened softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen Danville, health and fraternity!&rdquo; said Lomaque, appearing in the
      doorway, followed by his agents. &ldquo;Citizen Louis Trudaine?&rdquo; he continued,
      beginning with the usual form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose started out of her chair; but her brother&rsquo;s hand was on her lips
      before she could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Louis Trudaine,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles!&rdquo; cried his sister, breaking from him and appealing to her
      husband, &ldquo;who are these men? What are they here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louis Trudaine,&rdquo; said Lomaque, slowly, drawing the order from his pocket,
      &ldquo;in the name of the Republic, I arrest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, come back,&rdquo; cried Trudaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late; she had broken from him, and in the recklessness of
      terror, had seized her husband by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save him!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Save him, by all you hold dearest in the world!
      You are that man&rsquo;s superior, Charles&mdash;order him from the room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danville roughly shook her hand off his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lomaque is doing his duty. Yes,&rdquo; he added, with a glance of malicious
      triumph at Trudaine, &ldquo;yes, doing his duty. Look at me as you please&mdash;your
      looks won&rsquo;t move me. I denounced you! I admit it&mdash;I glory in it! I
      have rid myself of an enemy, and the State of a bad citizen. Remember your
      secret visits to the house in the Rue de Clery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife uttered a cry of horror. She seized his arm again with both hands&mdash;frail,
      trembling hands&mdash;that seemed suddenly nerved with all the strength of
      a man&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here&mdash;come here! I must and will speak to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dragged him by main force a few paces back, toward an unoccupied
      corner of the room. With deathly cheeks and wild eyes she raised herself
      on tiptoe, and put her lips to her husband&rsquo;s ear. At that instant Trudaine
      called to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, if you speak I am lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped at the sound of his voice, dropped her hold on her husband&rsquo;s
      arm, and faced her brother, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you have promised, and your promise is sacred. If
      you prize your honor, if you love me, come here&mdash;come here, and be
      silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand. She ran to him; and, laying her head on his bosom,
      burst into a passion of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danville turned uneasily toward the police agents. &ldquo;Remove your prisoner,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;You have done your duty here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only half of it,&rdquo; retorted Lomaque, eying him attentively. &ldquo;Rose Danville&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife!&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;What about my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose Danville,&rdquo; continued Lomaque, impassibly, &ldquo;you are included in the
      arrest of Louis Trudaine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose raised her head quickly from her brother&rsquo;s breast. His firmness had
      deserted him&mdash;he was trembling. She heard him whispering to himself,
      &ldquo;Rose, too! Oh, my God! I was not prepared for that.&rdquo; She heard these
      words, and dashed the tears from her eyes, and kissed him, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of it, Louis. We risked all together&mdash;we shall now suffer
      together. I am glad of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danville looked incredulously at Lomaque, after the first shock of
      astonishment was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I never denounced my wife. There is some
      mistake; you have exceeded your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; retorted Lomaque, imperiously. &ldquo;Silence, citizen, and respect
      to a decree of the Republic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You blackguard! show me the arrest-order!&rdquo; said Danville. &ldquo;Who has dared
      to denounce my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have!&rdquo; said Lomaque, turning on him with a grin of contempt. &ldquo;You&mdash;and
      &lsquo;blackguard&rsquo; back in your teeth! You, in denouncing her brother! Aha! we
      work hard in our office; we don&rsquo;t waste time in calling names&mdash;we
      make discoveries. If Trudaine is guilty, your wife is implicated in his
      guilt. We know it; and we arrest her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I resist the arrest,&rdquo; cried Danville. &ldquo;I am the authority here. Who
      opposes me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impassible chief agent made no answer. Some new noise in the street
      struck his quick ear. He ran to the window and looked out eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who opposes me?&rdquo; reiterated Danville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; exclaimed Lomaque, raising his hand. &ldquo;Silence, and listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy, dull tramp of men marching together became audible as he spoke.
      Voices humming low and in unison the Marseillaise hymn, joined solemnly
      with the heavy, regular footfalls. Soon the flare of torch-light began to
      glimmer redder and redder under the dim, starlight sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear that? Do you see the advancing torch-light?&rdquo; cried Lomaque,
      pointing exultingly into the street. &ldquo;Respect to the national hymn, and to
      the man who holds in the hollow of his hand the destinies of all France!
      Hat off, Citizen Danville! Robespierre is in the street. His bodyguard,
      the Hard-hitters, are lighting him on his way to the Jacobin Club! Who
      shall oppose you, did you say? Your master and mine; the man whose
      signature is at the bottom of this order&mdash;the man who with a scratch
      of his pen can send both our heads rolling together into the sack of the
      guillotine! Shall I call to him as he passes the house? Shall I tell him
      that Superintendent Danville resists me in making an arrest? Shall I?
      Shall I?&rdquo; And in the immensity of his contempt, Lomaque seemed absolutely
      to rise in stature, as he thrust the arrest order under Danville&rsquo;s eyes
      and pointed to the signature with the head of his stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose looked round in terror, as Lomaque spoke his last words&mdash;looked
      round, and saw her husband recoil before the signature on the arrest
      order, as if the guillotine itself had suddenly arisen before him. Her
      brother felt her shrinking back in his arms, and trembled for the
      preservation of her self-control if the terror and suspense of the arrest
      lasted any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, Rose, courage!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have behaved nobly; you must not
      fail now. No, no! Not a word more. Not a word till I am able to think
      clearly again, and to decide what is best. Courage, love; our lives depend
      on it. Citizen,&rdquo; he continued, addressing himself to Lomaque, &ldquo;proceed
      with your duty&mdash;we are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy marching footsteps outside were striking louder and louder on
      the ground; the chanting voices were every moment swelling in volume; the
      dark street was flaming again with the brightening torch-light, as
      Lomaque, under pretext of giving Trudaine his hat, came close to him, and,
      turning his back toward Danville, whispered: &ldquo;I have not forgotten the eve
      of the wedding and the bench on the river bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Trudaine could answer, he had taken Rose&rsquo;s cloak and hood from one
      of his assistants, and was helping her on with it. Danville, still pale
      and trembling, advanced a step when he saw these preparations for
      departure, and addressed a word or two to his wife; but he spoke in low
      tones, and the fast-advancing march of feet and sullen low roar of singing
      outside drowned his voice. An oath burst from his lips, and he struck his
      fist, in impotent fury, on a table near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The seals are set on everything in this room and in the bedroom,&rdquo; said
      Magloire, approaching Lomaque, who nodded and signed to him to bring up
      the other police agents at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; cried Magloire, coming forward immediately with his men, and
      raising his voice to make himself heard. &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre and his Hard-hitters were passing the house. The smoke of the
      torch-light was rolling in at the window; the tramping footsteps struck
      heavier and heavier on the ground; the low sullen roar of the Marseillaise
      was swelling to its loudest, as Lomaque referred for a moment to his
      arrest-order, and then answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the prison of St. Lazare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The head jailer of St. Lazare stood in the outer hall of the prison, two
      days after the arrest at Trudaine&rsquo;s lodgings, smoking his morning pipe.
      Looking toward the courtyard gate, he saw the wicket opened, and a
      privileged man let in, whom he soon recognized as the chief agent of the
      second section of Secret Police. &ldquo;Why, friend Lomaque,&rdquo; cried the jailer,
      advancing toward the courtyard, &ldquo;what brings you here this morning,
      business or pleasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasure, this time, citizen. I have an idle hour or two to spare for a
      walk. I find myself passing the prison, and I can&rsquo;t resist calling in to
      see how my friend the head jailer is getting on.&rdquo; Lomaque spoke in a
      surprisingly brisk and airy manner. His eyes were suffering under a
      violent fit of weakness and winking; but he smiled, notwithstanding, with
      an air of the most inveterate cheerfulness. Those old enemies of his, who
      always distrusted him most when his eyes were most affected, would have
      certainly disbelieved every word of the friendly speech he had just made,
      and would have assumed it as a matter of fact that his visit to the head
      jailer had some specially underhand business at the bottom of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I getting on?&rdquo; said the jailer, shaking his head. &ldquo;Overworked,
      friend&mdash;overworked. No idle hours in our department. Even the
      guillotine is getting too slow for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sent off your batch of prisoners for trial this morning?&rdquo; asked Lomaque,
      with an appearance of perfect unconcern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; they&rsquo;re just going,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;Come and have a look at
      them.&rdquo; He spoke as if the prisoners were a collection of pictures on view,
      or a set of dresses just made up. Lomaque nodded his head, still with his
      air of happy, holiday carelessness. The jailer led the way to an inner
      hall; and, pointing lazily with his pipe-stem, said: &ldquo;Our morning batch,
      citizen, just ready for the baking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one corner of the hall were huddled together more than thirty men and
      women of all ranks and ages; some staring round them with looks of blank
      despair; some laughing and gossiping recklessly. Near them lounged a guard
      of &ldquo;Patriots,&rdquo; smoking, spitting, and swearing. Between the patriots and
      the prisoners sat, on a rickety stool, the second jailer&mdash;a
      humpbacked man, with an immense red mustache&mdash;finishing his breakfast
      of broad beans, which he scooped out of a basin with his knife, and washed
      down with copious draughts of wine from a bottle. Carelessly as Lomaque
      looked at the shocking scene before him, his quick eyes contrived to take
      note of every prisoner&rsquo;s face, and to descry in a few minutes Trudaine and
      his sister standing together at the back of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Apollo!&rdquo; cried the head jailer, addressing his subordinate by a
      facetious prison nickname, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be all day starting that trumpery batch
      of yours. And harkye, friend, I have leave of absence, on business, at my
      Section this afternoon. So it will be your duty to read the list for the
      guillotine, and chalk the prisoners&rsquo; doors before the cart comes to-morrow
      morning. &lsquo;Ware the bottle, Apollo, to-day; &lsquo;ware the bottle, for fear of
      accidents with the death-list to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirsty July weather, this&mdash;eh, citizen?&rdquo; said Lomaque, leaving the
      head jailer, and patting the hunchback in the friendliest manner on the
      shoulder. &ldquo;Why, how you have got your batch huddled up together this
      morning! Shall I help you to shove them into marching order? My time is
      quite at your disposal. This is a holiday morning with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! what a jolly dog he is on his holiday morning!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      head jailer, as Lomaque&mdash;apparently taking leave of his natural
      character altogether in the exhilaration of an hour&rsquo;s unexpected leisure&mdash;began
      pushing and pulling the prisoners into rank, with humorous mock apologies,
      at which not the officials only, but many of the victims themselves&mdash;reckless
      victims of a reckless tyranny&mdash;laughed heartily. Persevering to the
      last in his practical jest, Lomaque contrived to get close to Trudaine for
      a minute, and to give him one significant look before he seized him by the
      shoulders, like the rest. &ldquo;Now, then, rear-guard,&rdquo; cried Lomaque, pushing
      Trudaine on, &ldquo;close the line of march, and mind you keep step with your
      young woman there. Pluck up your spirits, citoyenne! one gets used to
      everything in this world, even to the guillotine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was speaking and pushing at the same time, Trudaine felt a piece
      of paper slip quickly between his neck and his cravat. &ldquo;Courage!&rdquo; he
      whispered, pressing his sister&rsquo;s hand, as he saw her shuddering under the
      assumed brutality of Lomaque&rsquo;s joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surrounded by the guard of &ldquo;Patriots,&rdquo; the procession of prisoners moved
      slowly into the outer courtyard, on its way to the revolutionary tribunal,
      the humpbacked jailer bringing up the rear. Lomaque was about to follow at
      some little distance, but the head jailer hospitably expostulated. &ldquo;What a
      hurry you&rsquo;re in!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now that incorrigible drinker, my second in
      command, has gone off with his batch, I don&rsquo;t mind asking you to step in
      and have a drop of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered Lomaque; &ldquo;but I have rather a fancy for hearing the
      trial this morning. Suppose I come back afterward? What time do you go to
      your Section? At two o&rsquo;clock, eh? Good! I shall try if I can&rsquo;t get here
      soon after one.&rdquo; With these words he nodded and went out. The brilliant
      sunlight in the courtyard made him wink faster than ever. Had any of his
      old enemies been with him, they would have whispered within themselves,
      &ldquo;If you mean to come back at all, Citizen Lomaque, it will not be soon
      after one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his way through the streets, the chief agent met one or two police
      office friends, who delayed his progress; so that when he arrived at the
      revolutionary tribunal the trials of the day were just about to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal article of furniture in the Hall of Justice was a long,
      clumsy, deal table, covered with green baize. At the head of this table
      sat the president and his court, with their hats on, backed by a
      heterogeneous collection of patriots officially connected in various ways
      with the proceedings that were to take place. Below the front of the
      table, a railed-off space, with a gallery beyond, was appropriated to the
      general public&mdash;mostly represented, as to the gallery, on this
      occasion, by women, all sitting together on forms, knitting,
      shirt-mending, and baby-linen-making, as coolly as if they were at home.
      Parallel with the side of the table furthest from the great door of
      entrance was a low platform railed off, on which the prisoners, surrounded
      by their guard, were now assembled to await their trial. The sun shone in
      brightly from a high window, and a hum of ceaseless talking pervaded the
      hall cheerfully as Lomaque entered it. He was a privileged man here, as at
      the prison; and he made his way in by a private door, so as to pass to the
      prisoners&rsquo; platform, and to walk round it, before he got to a place behind
      the president&rsquo;s chair. Trudaine, standing with his sister on the outermost
      limits of the group, nodded significantly as Lomaque looked up at him for
      an instant. He had contrived, on his way to the tribunal, to get an
      opportunity of reading the paper which the chief agent had slipped into
      his cravat. It contained these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just discovered who the citizen and citoyenne Dubois are. There is
      no chance for you but to confess everything. By that means you may
      inculpate a certain citizen holding authority, and may make it his
      interest, if he loves his own life, to save yours and your sister&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the back of the president&rsquo;s chair, Lomaque recognized his two
      trusty subordinates, Magloire and Picard, waiting among the assembled
      patriot officials, to give their evidence. Beyond them, leaning against
      the wall, addressed by no one, and speaking to no one, stood the
      superintendent, Danville. Doubt and suspense were written in every line of
      his face; the fretfulness of an uneasy mind expressed itself in his
      slightest gesture&mdash;even in his manner of passing a handkerchief from
      time to time over his face, on which the perspiration was gathering thick
      and fast already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried the usher of the court for the time being&mdash;a
      hoarse-voiced man in top-boots with a huge saber buckled to his side, and
      a bludgeon in his hand. &ldquo;Silence for the Citizen President!&rdquo; he
      reiterated, striking his bludgeon on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president rose and proclaimed that the sitting for the day had begun;
      then sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The momentary silence which followed was interrupted by a sudden confusion
      among the prisoners on the platform. Two of the guards sprang in among
      them. There was the thump of a heavy fall&mdash;a scream of terror from
      some of the female prisoners&mdash;then another dead silence, broken by
      one of the guards, who walked across the hall with a bloody knife in his
      hand, and laid it on the table. &ldquo;Citizen President,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have to
      report that one of the prisoners has just stabbed himself.&rdquo; There was a
      murmuring exclamation, &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; among the women spectators, as they
      resumed their work. Suicide at the bar of justice was no uncommon
      occurrence, under the Reign of Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name?&rdquo; asked the president, quietly taking up his pen and opening a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martigne,&rdquo; answered the humpbacked jailer, coming forward to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Description?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ex-royalist coach-maker to the tyrant Capet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accusation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conspiracy in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president nodded, and entered in the book: &ldquo;Martigne, coachmaker.
      Accused of conspiring in prison. Anticipated course of law by suicide.
      Action accepted as sufficient confession of guilt. Goods confiscated. 1st
      Thermidor, year two of the Republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried the man with the bludgeon, as the president dropped a
      little sand on the entry, and signing to the jailer that he might remove
      the dead body, closed the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any special cases this morning?&rdquo; resumed the president, looking round at
      the group behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one,&rdquo; said Lomaque, making his way to the back of the official
      chair. &ldquo;Will it be convenient to you, citizen, to take the case of Louis
      Trudaine and Rose Danville first? Two of my men are detained here as
      witnesses, and their time is valuable to the Republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president marked a list of names before him, and handed it to the
      crier or usher, placing the figures one and two against Louis Trudaine and
      Rose Danville.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Lomaque was backing again to his former place behind the chair,
      Danville approached and whispered to him, &ldquo;There is a rumor that secret
      information has reached you about the citizen and citoyenne Dubois. Is it
      true? Do you know who they are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Lomaque; &ldquo;but I have superior orders to keep the
      information to myself just at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eagerness with which Danville put his question, and the disappointment
      he showed on getting no satisfactory answer to it, were of a nature to
      satisfy the observant chief agent that his superintendent was really as
      ignorant as he appeared to be on the subject of the man and woman Dubois.
      That one mystery, at any rate was still, for Danville, a mystery
      unrevealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louis Trudaine! Rose Danville!&rdquo; shouted the crier, with another rap of
      his bludgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two came forward, at the appeal, to the front railing of the platform.
      The first sight of her judges, the first shock on confronting the pitiless
      curiosity of the audience, seemed to overwhelm Rose. She turned from
      deadly pale to crimson, then to pale again, and hid her face on her
      brother&rsquo;s shoulder. How fast she heard his heart throbbing! How the tears
      filled her eyes as she felt that his fear was all for her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the president, writing down their names. &ldquo;Denounced by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Magloire and Picard stepped forward to the table. The first answered&mdash;&ldquo;By
      Citizen Superintendent Danville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply made a great stir and sensation among both prisoners and
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accused of what?&rdquo; pursued the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The male prisoner, of conspiracy against the Republic; the female
      prisoner, of criminal knowledge of the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Produce your proofs in answer to this order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Picard and Magloire opened their minutes of evidence, and read to the
      president the same particulars which they had formerly read to Lomaque in
      the secret police office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the president, when they had done, &ldquo;we need trouble ourselves
      with nothing more than the identifying of the citizen and citoyenne
      Dubois, which, of course, you are prepared for. Have you heard the
      evidence?&rdquo; he continued, turning to the prisoners; while Picard and
      Magloire consulted together in whispers, looking perplexedly toward the
      chief agent, who stood silent behind them. &ldquo;Have you heard the evidence,
      prisoners? Do you wish to say anything? If you do, remember that the time
      of this tribunal is precious, and that you will not be suffered to waste
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand permission to speak for myself and for my sister,&rdquo; answered
      Trudaine. &ldquo;My object is to save the time of the tribunal by making a
      confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faint whispering, audible among the women spectators a moment before,
      ceased instantaneously as he pronounced the word confession. In the
      breathless silence, his low, quiet tones penetrated to the remotest
      corners of the hall; while, suppressing externally all evidences of the
      death-agony of hope within him, he continued his address in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess my secret visits to the house in the Rue de Clery. I confess
      that the persons whom I went to see are the persons pointed at in the
      evidence. And, lastly, I confess that my object in communicating with them
      as I did was to supply them with the means of leaving France. If I had
      acted from political motives to the political prejudice of the existing
      government, I admit that I should be guilty of that conspiracy against the
      Republic with which I am charged. But no political purpose animated, no
      political necessity urged me, in performing the action which has brought
      me to the bar of this tribunal. The persons whom I aided in leaving France
      were without political influence or political connections. I acted solely
      from private motives of humanity toward them and toward others&mdash;motives
      which a good republican may feel, and yet not turn traitor to the welfare
      of his country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready to inform the court, next, who the man and woman Dubois
      really are?&rdquo; inquired the president, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; answered Trudaine. &ldquo;But first I desire to say one word in
      reference to my sister, charged here at the bar with me.&rdquo; His voice grew
      less steady, and, for the first time, his color began to change, as Rose
      lifted her face from his shoulder and looked up at him eagerly. &ldquo;I implore
      the tribunal to consider my sister as innocent of all active participation
      in what is charged against me as a crime&mdash;&rdquo; He went on. &ldquo;Having
      spoken with candor about myself, I have some claim to be believed when I
      speak of her; when I assert that she neither did help me nor could help
      me. If there be blame, it is mine only; if punishment, it is I alone who
      should suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly, and grew confused. It was easy to guard himself from
      the peril of looking at Rose, but he could not escape the hard trial to
      his self-possession of hearing her, if she spoke. Just as he pronounced
      the last sentence, she raised her face again from his shoulder, and
      eagerly whispered to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Louis! Not that sacrifice, after all the others&mdash;not that,
      though you should force me into speaking to them myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She abruptly quitted her hold of him, and fronted the whole court in an
      instant. The railing in front of her shook with the quivering of her arms
      and hands as she held by it to support herself! Her hair lay tangled on
      her shoulders; her face had assumed a strange fixedness; her gentle blue
      eyes, so soft and tender at all other times, were lit up wildly. A low hum
      of murmured curiosity and admiration broke from the women of the audience.
      Some rose eagerly from the benches; others cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, listen! she is going to speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did speak. Silvery and pure the sweet voice, sweeter than ever in
      sadness, stole its way through the gross sounds&mdash;through the coarse
      humming and the hissing whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord the president,&rdquo; began the poor girl firmly. Her next words were
      drowned in a volley of hisses from the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! aristocrat, aristocrat! None of your accursed titles here!&rdquo; was their
      shrill cry at her. She fronted that cry, she fronted the fierce gestures
      which accompanied it, with the steady light still in her eyes, with the
      strange rigidity still fastened on her face. She would have spoken again
      through the uproar and execration, but her brother&rsquo;s voice overpowered
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen president,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I have not concluded. I demand leave to
      complete my confession. I implore the tribunal to attach no importance to
      what my sister says. The trouble and terror of this day have shaken her
      intellects. She is not responsible for her words&mdash;I assert it
      solemnly, in the face of the whole court!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood flew up into his white face as he made the asseveration. Even at
      that supreme moment the great heart of the man reproached him for yielding
      himself to a deception, though the motive of it was to save his sister&rsquo;s
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her speak! let her speak!&rdquo; exclaimed the women, as Rose, without
      moving, without looking at her brother, without seeming even to have heard
      what he said, made a second attempt to address her judges, in spite of
      Trudaine&rsquo;s interposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; shouted the man with the bludgeon. &ldquo;Silence, you women! the
      citizen president is going to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prisoner Trudaine has the ear of the court,&rdquo; said the president, &ldquo;and
      may continue his confession. If the female prisoner wishes to speak, she
      may be heard afterward. I enjoin both the accused persons to make short
      work of it with their addresses to me, or they will make their case worse
      instead of better. I command silence among the audience, and if I am not
      obeyed, I will clear the hall. Now, prisoner Trudaine, I invite you to
      proceed. No more about your sister; let her speak for herself. Your
      business and ours is with the man and woman Dubois. Are you, or are you
      not, ready to tell the court who they are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat that I am ready,&rdquo; answered Trudaine. &ldquo;The citizen Dubois is a
      servant. The woman Dubois is the mother of the man who denounces me&mdash;Superintendent
      Danville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A low, murmuring, rushing sound of hundreds of exclaiming voices, all
      speaking, half-suppressedly, at the same moment, followed the delivery of
      the answer. No officer of the court attempted to control the outburst of
      astonishment. The infection of it spread to the persons on the platform,
      to the crier himself, to the judges of the tribunal, lounging, but the
      moment before, so carelessly silent in their chairs. When the noise was at
      length quelled, it was subdued in the most instantaneous manner by one
      man, who shouted from the throng behind the president&rsquo;s chair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clear the way there! Superintendent Danville is taken ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vehement whispering and contending of many voices interrupting each
      other, followed; then a swaying among the assembly of official people;
      then a great stillness; then the sudden appearance of Danville, alone, at
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look of him, as he turned his ghastly face toward the audience,
      silenced and steadied them in an instant, just as they were on the point
      of falling into fresh confusion. Every one stretched forward eagerly to
      hear what he would say. His lips moved; but the few words that fell from
      them were inaudible, except to the persons who happened to be close by
      him. Having spoken, he left the table supported by a police agent, who was
      seen to lead him toward the private door of the court, and, consequently,
      also toward the prisoners&rsquo; platform. He stopped, however, halfway, quickly
      turned his face from the prisoners, and pointing toward the public door at
      the opposite side of the hall, caused himself to be led out into the air
      by that direction. When he had gone the president, addressing himself
      partly to Trudaine and partly to the audience, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Citizen Superintendent Danville has been overcome by the heat in the
      court. He has retired by my desire, under the care of a police agent, to
      recover in the open air; pledging himself to me to come back and throw a
      new light on the extraordinary and suspicious statement which the prisoner
      has just made. Until the return of Citizen Danville, I order the accused,
      Trudaine, to suspend any further acknowledgment of complicity which he may
      have to address to me. This matter must be cleared up before other matters
      are entered on. Meanwhile, in order that the time of the tribunal may not
      be wasted, I authorize the female prisoner to take this opportunity of
      making any statement concerning herself which she may wish to address to
      the judges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Remove him out of court!&rdquo; &ldquo;Gag him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Guillotine him!&rdquo;
       These cries rose from the audience the moment the president had done
      speaking. They were all directed at Trudaine, who had made a last
      desperate effort to persuade his sister to keep silence, and had been
      detected in the attempt by the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the prisoner speaks another word to his sister, remove him,&rdquo; said the
      president, addressing the guard round the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! we shall hear her at last. Silence! silence!&rdquo; exclaimed the women,
      settling themselves comfortably on their benches, and preparing to resume
      their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose Danville, the court is waiting to hear you,&rdquo; said the president,
      crossing his legs and leaning back luxuriously in his large armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid all the noise and confusion of the last few minutes, Rose had stood
      ever in the same attitude, with that strangely fixed expression never
      altering on her face but once. When her husband made his way to the side
      of the table and stood there prominently alone, her lips trembled a
      little, and a faint shade of color passed swiftly over her cheeks. Even
      that slight change had vanished now&mdash;she was paler, stiller, more
      widely altered from her former self than ever, as she faced the president
      and said these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to follow my brother&rsquo;s example and make my confession, as he has
      made his. I would rather he had spoken for me; but he is too generous to
      say any words except such as he thinks may save me from sharing his
      punishment. I refuse to be saved, unless he is saved with me. Where he
      goes when he leaves this place, I will go; what he suffers, I will suffer;
      if he is to die, I believe God will grant me the strength to die
      resignedly with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a moment, and half turned toward Trudaine&mdash;then
      checked herself instantly and went on: &ldquo;This is what I now wish to say, as
      to my share in the offense charged against my brother. Some time ago, he
      told me one day that he had seen my husband&rsquo;s mother in Paris, disguised
      as a poor woman; that he had spoken to her, and forced her to acknowledge
      herself. Up to this time we had all felt certain that she had left France,
      because she held old-fashioned opinions which it is dangerous for people
      to hold now&mdash;had left France before we came to Paris. She told my
      brother that she had indeed gone (with an old, tried servant of the family
      to help and protect her) as far as Marseilles; and that, finding
      unforeseen difficulty there in getting further, she had taken it as a
      warning from Providence not to desert her son, of whom she was very
      passionately fond, and from whom she had been most unwilling to depart.
      Instead of waiting in exile for quieter times, she determined to go and
      hide herself in Paris, knowing her son was going there too. She assumed
      the name of her old and faithful servant, who declined to the last to
      leave her unprotected; and she proposed to live in the strictest secrecy
      and retirement, watching, unknown, the career of her son, and ready at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice to disclose herself to him, when the settlement of public
      affairs might reunite her safely to her beloved child. My brother thought
      this plan full of danger, both for herself, for her son, and for the
      honest old man who was risking his head for his mistress&rsquo;s sake. I thought
      so too; and in an evil hour I said to Louis: &lsquo;Will you try in secret to
      get my husband&rsquo;s mother away, and see that her faithful servant makes her
      really leave France this time?&rsquo; I wrongly asked my brother to do this for
      a selfish reason of my own&mdash;a reason connected with my married life,
      which has not been a happy one. I had not succeeded in gaining my
      husband&rsquo;s affection, and was not treated kindly by him. My brother&mdash;who
      has always loved me far more dearly, I am afraid, than I have ever
      deserved&mdash;my brother increased his kindness to me, seeing me treated
      unkindly by my husband. This made ill-blood between them. My thought, when
      I asked my brother to do for me what I have said, was, that if we two in
      secret saved my husband&rsquo;s mother, without danger to him, from imperiling
      herself and her son, we should, when the time came for speaking of what we
      had done, appear to my husband in a new and better light. I should have
      shown how well I deserved his love, and Louis would have shown how well he
      deserved his brother-in-law&rsquo;s gratitude; and so we should have made home
      happy at last, and all three have lived together affectionately. This was
      my thought; and when I told it to my brother, and asked him if there would
      be much risk, out of his kindness and indulgence toward me, he said &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
      He had so used me to accept sacrifices for my happiness that I let him
      endanger himself to help me in my little household plan. I repent this
      bitterly now; I ask his pardon with my whole heart. If he is acquitted, I
      will try to show myself worthier of his love. If he is found guilty, I,
      too, will go to the scaffold, and die with my brother, who risked his life
      for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased as quietly as she had begun, and turned once more to her
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she looked away from the court and looked at him, a few tears came into
      her eyes, and something of the old softness of form and gentleness of
      expression seemed to return to her face. He let her take his hand, but he
      seemed purposely to avoid meeting the anxious gaze she fixed on him. His
      head sunk on his breast; he drew his breath heavily, his countenance
      darkened and grew distorted, as if he were suffering some sharp pang of
      physical pain. He bent down a little, and, leaning his elbow on the rail
      before him, covered his face with his hand; and so quelled the rising
      agony, so forced back the scalding tears to his heart. The audience had
      heard Rose in silence, and they preserved the same tranquillity when she
      had done. This was a rare tribute to a prisoner from the people of the
      Reign of Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president looked round at his colleagues, and shook his head
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This statement of the female prisoner&rsquo;s complicates the matter very
      seriously,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Is there anybody in court,&rdquo; he added, looking at the
      persons behind his chair, &ldquo;who knows where the mother of Superintendent
      Danville and the servant are now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque came forward at the appeal, and placed himself by the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, citizen agent!&rdquo; continued the president, looking hard at him, &ldquo;are
      you overcome by the heat, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fit seemed to take him, citizen president, when the female prisoner
      had made an end of her statement,&rdquo; exclaimed Magloire, pressing forward
      officiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque gave his subordinate a look which sent the man back directly to
      the shelter of the official group; then said, in lower tones than were
      customary with him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have received information relative to the mother of Superintendent
      Danville and the servant, and am ready to answer any questions that may be
      put to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo; asked the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She and the servant are known to have crossed the frontier, and are
      supposed to be on their way to Cologne. But, since they have entered
      Germany, their whereabouts is necessarily a matter of uncertainty to the
      republican authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any information relative to the conduct of the old servant while
      he was in Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have information enough to prove that he was not an object for
      political suspicion. He seems to have been simply animated by servile zeal
      for the woman&rsquo;s interests; to have performed for her all the menial
      offices of a servant in private; and to have misled the neighbors by
      affected equality with her in public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any reason to believe that Superintendent Danville was privy to
      his mother&rsquo;s first attempt at escaping from France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I infer it from what the female prisoner has said, and for other reasons
      which it would be irregular to detail before the tribunal. The proofs can
      no doubt be obtained if I am allowed time to communicate with the
      authorities at Lyons and Marseilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Danville re-entered the court; and, advancing to the table,
      placed himself close by the chief agent&rsquo;s side. They looked each other
      steadily in the face for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has recovered from the shock of Trudaine&rsquo;s answer,&rdquo; thought Lomaque,
      retiring. &ldquo;His hand trembles, his face is pale, but I can see regained
      self-possession in his eye, and I dread the consequences already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen president,&rdquo; began Danville, &ldquo;I demand to know if anything has
      transpired affecting my honor and patriotism in my absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke apparently with the most perfect calmness, but he looked nobody
      in the face. His eyes were fixed steadily on the green baize of the table
      beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The female prisoner has made a statement, referring principally to
      herself and her brother,&rdquo; answered the president, &ldquo;but incidentally
      mentioning a previous attempt on your mother&rsquo;s part to break existing laws
      by emigrating from France. This portion of the confession contains in it
      some elements of suspicion which seriously affect you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall be suspicions no longer&mdash;at my own peril I will change
      them to certainties!&rdquo; exclaimed Danville, extending his arm theatrically,
      and looking up for the first time. &ldquo;Citizen president, I avow it with the
      fearless frankness of a good patriot; I was privy to my mother&rsquo;s first
      attempt at escaping from France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hisses and cries of execration followed this confession. He winced under
      them at first; but recovered his self-possession before silence was
      restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizens, you have heard the confession of my fault,&rdquo; he resumed, turning
      with desperate assurance toward the audience; &ldquo;now hear the atonement I
      have made for it at the altar of my country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited at the end of that sentence, until the secretary to the tribunal
      had done writing it down in the report book of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Transcribe faithfully to the letter!&rdquo; cried Danville, pointing solemnly
      to the open page of the volume. &ldquo;Life and death hang on my words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary took a fresh dip of ink, and nodded to show that he was
      ready. Danville went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In these times of glory and trial for France,&rdquo; he proceeded, pitching his
      voice to a tone of deep emotion, &ldquo;what are all good citizens most sacredly
      bound to do? To immolate their dearest private affections and interests
      before their public duties! On the first attempt of my mother to violate
      the laws against emigration, by escaping from France, I failed in making
      the heroic sacrifice which inexorable patriotism demanded of me. My
      situation was more terrible than the situation of Brutus sitting in
      judgment on his own sons. I had not the Roman fortitude to rise equal to
      it. I erred, citizens&mdash;erred as Coriolanus did, when his august
      mother pleaded with him for the safety of Rome! For that error I deserved
      to be purged out of the republican community; but I escaped my merited
      punishment&mdash;nay, I even rose to the honor of holding an office under
      the Government. Time passed; and again my mother attempted an escape from
      France. Again, inevitable fate brought my civic virtue to the test. How
      did I meet this second supremest trial? By an atonement for past weakness,
      terrible as the trial itself. Citizens, you will shudder; but you will
      applaud while you tremble. Citizens, look! and while you look, remember
      well the evidence given at the opening of this case. Yonder stands the
      enemy of his country, who intrigued to help my mother to escape; here
      stands the patriot son, whose voice was the first, the only voice, to
      denounce him for the crime!&rdquo; As he spoke, he pointed to Trudaine, then
      struck himself on the breast, then folded his arms, and looked sternly at
      the benches occupied by the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you assert,&rdquo; exclaimed the president, &ldquo;that at the time when you
      denounced Trudaine, you knew him to be intriguing to aid your mother&rsquo;s
      escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assert it,&rdquo; answered Danville.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pen which the president held dropped from his hand at that reply; his
      colleagues started, and looked at each other in blank silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of &ldquo;Monster! monster!&rdquo; began with the prisoners on the platform,
      and spread instantly to the audience, who echoed and echoed it again; the
      fiercest woman-republican on the benches joined cause at last with the
      haughtiest woman-aristocrat on the platform. Even in that sphere of direst
      discords, in that age of sharpest enmities, the one touch of Nature
      preserved its old eternal virtue, and roused the mother-instinct which
      makes the whole world kin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the few persons in the court who at once foresaw the effect of
      Danville&rsquo;s answer on the proceedings of the tribunal, Lomaque was one. His
      sallow face whitened as he looked toward the prisoners&rsquo; platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are lost,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, moving out of the group in which
      he had hitherto stood. &ldquo;Lost! The lie which has saved that villain&rsquo;s head
      leaves them without the shadow of a hope. No need to stop for the sentence&mdash;Danville&rsquo;s
      infamous presence of mind has given them up to the guillotine!&rdquo;
       Pronouncing these words, he went out hurriedly by a door near the
      platform, which led to the prisoners&rsquo; waiting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose&rsquo;s head sank again on her brother&rsquo;s shoulder. She shuddered, and
      leaned back faintly on the arm which he extended to support her. One of
      the female prisoners tried to help Trudaine in speaking consolingly to
      her; but the consummation of her husband&rsquo;s perfidy seemed to have
      paralyzed her at heart. She murmured once in her brother&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Louis! I
      am resigned to die&mdash;nothing but death is left for me after the
      degradation of having loved that man.&rdquo; She said those words and closed her
      eyes wearily, and spoke no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One other question, and you may retire,&rdquo; resumed the president,
      addressing Danville. &ldquo;Were you cognizant of your wife&rsquo;s connection with
      her brother&rsquo;s conspiracy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danville reflected for a moment, remembered that there were witnesses in
      court who could speak to his language and behavior on the evening of his
      wife&rsquo;s arrest, and resolved this time to tell the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware of it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Testimony in my favor can be called
      which will prove that when my wife&rsquo;s complicity was discovered I was
      absent from Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heartlessly self-possessed as he was, the public reception of his last
      reply had shaken his nerve. He now spoke in low tones, turning his back on
      the spectators, and fixing his eyes again on the green baize of the table
      at which he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prisoners, have you any objection to make, any evidence to call,
      invalidating the statement by which Citizen Danville has cleared himself
      of suspicion?&rdquo; inquired the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has cleared himself by the most execrable of all falsehoods,&rdquo; answered
      Trudaine. &ldquo;If his mother could be traced and brought here, her testimony
      would prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you produce any other evidence in support of your allegation?&rdquo; asked
      the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen Superintendent Danville, you are at liberty to retire. Your
      statement will be laid before the authority to whom you are officially
      responsible. Either you merit a civic crown for more than Roman virtue, or&mdash;&rdquo;
       Having got thus far, the president stopped abruptly, as if unwilling to
      commit himself too soon to an opinion, and merely repeated, &ldquo;You may
      retire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danville left the court immediately, going out again by the public door.
      He was followed by murmurs from the women&rsquo;s benches, which soon ceased,
      however, when the president was observed to close his note-book, and turn
      round toward his colleagues. &ldquo;The sentence!&rdquo; was the general whisper now.
      &ldquo;Hush, hush&mdash;the sentence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a consultation of a few minutes with the persons behind him, the
      president rose, and spoke the momentous words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louis Trudaine and Rose Danville, the revolutionary tribunal, having
      heard the charge against you, and having weighed the value of what you
      have said in answer to it, decides that you are both guilty, and condemns
      you to the penalty of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered the sentence in those terms, he sat down again, and
      placed a mark against the two first condemned names on the list of
      prisoners. Immediately afterward the next case was called on, and the
      curiosity of the audience was stimulated by a new trial.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The waiting-room of the revolutionary tribunal was a grim, bare place,
      with a dirty stone floor, and benches running round the walls. The windows
      were high and barred; and at the outer door, leading into the street, two
      sentinels kept watch. On entering this comfortless retreat from the court,
      Lomaque found it perfectly empty. Solitude was just then welcome to him.
      He remained in the waiting-room, walking slowly from end to end over the
      filthy pavement, talking eagerly and incessantly to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, the door communicating with the tribunal opened, and the
      humpbacked jailer made his appearance, leading in Trudaine and Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to wait here,&rdquo; said the little man, &ldquo;till the rest of them
      have been tried and sentenced; and then you will all go back to prison in
      a lump. Ha, citizen,&rdquo; he continued, observing Lomaque at the other end of
      the hall, and bustling up to him. &ldquo;Here still, eh? If you were going to
      stop much longer, I should ask a favor of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in no hurry,&rdquo; said Lomaque, with a glance at the two prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried the humpback, drawing his hand across his mouth; &ldquo;I am
      parched with thirst, and dying to moisten my throat at the wine-shop over
      the way. Just mind that man and woman while I&rsquo;m gone, will you? It&rsquo;s the
      merest form&mdash;there&rsquo;s a guard outside, the windows are barred, the
      tribunal is within hail. Do you mind obliging me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I am glad of the opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good fellow&mdash;and, remember, if I am asked for, you must say
      I was obliged to quit the court for a few minutes, and left you in
      charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, the humpbacked jailer ran off to the wine-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely disappeared before Trudaine crossed the room, and caught
      Lomaque by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save her,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;there is an opportunity&mdash;save her!&rdquo; His
      face was flushed&mdash;his eyes wandered&mdash;his breath on the chief
      agent&rsquo;s cheek, while he spoke, felt scorching hot. &ldquo;Save her!&rdquo; he
      repeated, shaking Lomaque by the arm, and dragging him toward the door.
      &ldquo;Remember all you owe to my father&mdash;remember our talk on that bench
      by the river&mdash;remember what you said to me yourself on the night of
      the arrest&mdash;don&rsquo;t wait to think&mdash;save her, and leave me without
      a word! If I die alone, I can die as a man should; if she goes to the
      scaffold by my side, my heart will fail me&mdash;I shall die the death of
      a coward! I have lived for her life&mdash;let me die for it, and I die
      happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to say more, but the violence of his agitation forbade it. He
      could only shake the arm he held again and again, and point to the bench
      on which Rose sat&mdash;her head sunk on her bosom, her hands crossed
      listlessly on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two armed sentinels outside&mdash;the windows are barred&mdash;you
      are without weapons&mdash;and even if you had them, there is a guard-house
      within hail on one side of you, and the tribunal on the other. Escape from
      this room is impossible,&rdquo; answered Lomaque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; repeated the other, furiously. &ldquo;You traitor! you coward! can
      you look at her sitting there helpless, her very life ebbing away already
      with every minute that passes, and tell me coolly that escape is
      impossible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the frenzy of his grief and despair, he lifted his disengaged hand
      threateningly while he spoke. Lomaque caught him by the wrist, and drew
      him toward a window open at the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not in your right senses,&rdquo; said the chief agent, firmly; &ldquo;anxiety
      and apprehension on your sister&rsquo;s account have shaken your mind. Try to
      compose yourself, and listen to me. I have something important to say&mdash;&rdquo;
       (Trudaine looked at him incredulously.) &ldquo;Important,&rdquo; continued Lomaque,
      &ldquo;as affecting your sister&rsquo;s interests at this terrible crisis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That last appeal had an instantaneous effect. Trudaine&rsquo;s outstretched hand
      dropped to his side, and a sudden change passed over his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a moment,&rdquo; he said, faintly; and turning away, leaned against the
      wall and pressed his burning forehead on the chill, damp stone. He did not
      raise his head again till he had mastered himself, and could say quietly,
      &ldquo;Speak; I am fit to hear you, and sufficiently in my senses to ask your
      forgiveness for what I said just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I left the tribunal and entered this room,&rdquo; Lomaque began in a
      whisper, &ldquo;there was no thought in my mind that could be turned to good
      account, either for your sister or for you. I was fit for nothing but to
      deplore the failure of the confession which I came to St. Lazare to
      suggest to you as your best plan of defense. Since then, an idea has
      struck me, which may be useful&mdash;an idea so desperate, so uncertain&mdash;involving
      a proposal so absolutely dependent, as to its successful execution, on the
      merest chance, that I refuse to confide it to you except on one
      condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mention the condition! I submit to it before hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your word of honor that you will not mention what I am about to
      say to your sister until I grant you permission to speak. Promise me that
      when you see her shrinking before the terrors of death to-night, you will
      have self-restraint enough to abstain from breathing a word of hope to
      her. I ask this, because there are ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;fifty chances to
      one that there <i>is</i> no hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no choice but to promise,&rdquo; answered Trudaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque produced his pocket-book and pencil before he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will enter into particulars as soon as I have asked a strange question
      of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have been a great experimenter in chemistry in your
      time&mdash;is your mind calm enough, at such a trying moment as this, to
      answer a question which is connected with chemistry in a very humble way?
      You seem astonished. Let me put the question at once. Is there any liquid
      or powder, or combination of more than one ingredient known, which will
      remove writing from paper, and leave no stain behind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly! But is that all the question? Is there no greater difficulty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. Write the prescription, whatever it may be, on that leaf,&rdquo; said the
      other, giving him the pocket-book. &ldquo;Write it down, with plain directions
      for use.&rdquo; Trudaine obeyed. &ldquo;This is the first step,&rdquo; continued Lomaque,
      putting the book in his pocket, &ldquo;toward the accomplishment of my purpose&mdash;my
      uncertain purpose, remember! Now, listen; I am going to put my own head in
      danger for the chance of saving yours and your sister&rsquo;s by tampering with
      the death-list. Don&rsquo;t interrupt me! If I can save one, I can save the
      other. Not a word about gratitude! Wait till you know the extent of your
      obligation. I tell you plainly, at the outset, there is a motive of
      despair, as well as a motive of pity, at the bottom of the action in which
      I am now about to engage. Silence! I insist on it. Our time is short; it
      is for me to speak, and for you to listen. The president of the tribunal
      has put the deathmark against your names on the prison list of to-day.
      That list, when the trials are over and it is marked to the end, will be
      called in this room before you are taken to St. Lazare. It will then be
      sent to Robespierre, who will keep it, having a copy made of it the moment
      it is delivered, for circulation among his colleagues&mdash;St. Just, and
      the rest. It is my business to make a duplicate of this copy in the first
      instance. The duplicate will be compared with the original, and possibly
      with the copy, too, either by Robespierre himself, or by some one in whom
      he can place implicit trust, and will then be sent to St. Lazare without
      passing through my hands again. It will be read in public the moment it is
      received, at the grating of the prison, and will afterward be kept by the
      jailer, who will refer to it, as he goes round in the evening with a piece
      of chalk, to mark the cell doors of the prisoners destined for the
      guillotine to-morrow. That duty happens, to-day, to fall to the hunchback
      whom you saw speaking to me. He is a confirmed drinker, and I mean to
      tempt him with such wine as he rarely tastes. If&mdash;after the reading
      of the list in public, and before the marking of the cell doors&mdash;I
      can get him to sit down to the bottle, I will answer for making him drunk,
      for getting the list out of his pocket, and for wiping your names out of
      it with the prescription you have just written for me. I shall write all
      the names, one under another, just irregularly enough in my duplicate to
      prevent the interval left by the erasure from being easily observed. If I
      succeed in this, your door will not be marked, and your names will not be
      called to-morrow morning when the tumbrils come for the guillotine. In the
      present confusion of prisoners pouring in every day for trial, and
      prisoners pouring out every day for execution, you will have the best
      possible chance of security against awkward inquiries, if you play your
      cards properly, for a good fortnight or ten days at least. In that time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! well!&rdquo; cried Trudaine, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque looked toward the tribunal door, and lowered his voice to a
      fainter whisper before he continued, &ldquo;In that time Robespierre&rsquo;s own head
      may fall into the sack! France is beginning to sicken under the Reign of
      Terror. Frenchmen of the Moderate faction, who have lain hidden for months
      in cellars and lofts, are beginning to steal out and deliberate by twos
      and threes together, under cover of the night. Robespierre has not
      ventured for weeks past to face the Convention Committee. He only speaks
      among his own friends at the Jacobins. There are rumors of a terrible
      discovery made by Carnot, of a desperate resolution taken by Tallien. Men
      watching behind the scenes see that the last days of the Terror are at
      hand. If Robespierre is beaten in the approaching struggle, you are saved&mdash;for
      the new reign must be a Reign of Mercy. If he conquers, I have only put
      off the date of your death and your sister&rsquo;s, and have laid my own neck
      under the axe. Those are your chances&mdash;this is all I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and Trudaine again endeavored to speak such words as might show
      that he was not unworthy of the deadly risk which Lomaque was prepared to
      encounter. But once more the chief agent peremptorily and irritably
      interposed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, for the third time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will listen to no
      expressions of gratitude from you till I know when I deserve them. It is
      true that I recollect your father&rsquo;s timely kindness to me&mdash;true that
      I have not forgotten what passed, five years since at your house by the
      river-side. I remember everything, down to what you would consider the
      veriest trifle&mdash;that cup of coffee, for instance, which your sister
      kept hot for me. I told you then that you would think better of me some
      day. I know that you do now. But this is not all. You want to glorify me
      to my face for risking my life for you. I won&rsquo;t hear you, because my risk
      is of the paltriest kind. I am weary of my life. I can&rsquo;t look back to it
      with pleasure. I am too old to look forward to what is left of it with
      hope. There was something in that night at your house before the wedding&mdash;something
      in what you said, in what your sister did&mdash;which altered me. I have
      had my days of gloom and self-reproach, from time to time, since then. I
      have sickened at my slavery, and subjection, and duplicity, and cringing,
      first under one master then under another. I have longed to look back at
      my life, and comfort myself with the sight of some good action, just as a
      frugal man comforts himself with the sight of his little savings laid by
      in an old drawer. I can&rsquo;t do this, and I want to do it. The want takes me
      like a fit, at uncertain intervals&mdash;suddenly, under the most
      incomprehensible influences. A glance up at the blue sky&mdash;starlight
      over the houses of this great city, when I look out at the night from my
      garret window&mdash;a child&rsquo;s voice coming suddenly, I don&rsquo;t know where
      from&mdash;the piping of my neighbor&rsquo;s linnet in his little cage&mdash;now
      one trifling thing, now another&mdash;wakes up that want in me in a
      moment. Rascal as I am, those few simple words your sister spoke to the
      judge went through and through me like a knife. Strange, in a man like me,
      isn&rsquo;t it? I am amazed at it myself. <i>My</i> life? Bah! I&rsquo;ve let it out
      for hire to be kicked about by rascals from one dirty place to another,
      like a football! It&rsquo;s my whim to give it a last kick myself, and throw it
      away decently before it lodges on the dunghill forever. Your sister kept a
      good cup of coffee hot for me, and I give her a bad life in return for the
      compliment. You want to thank me for it? What folly! Thank me when I have
      done something useful. Don&rsquo;t thank me for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snapped his fingers contemptuously as he spoke, and walked away to the
      outer door to receive the jailer, who returned at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; inquired the hunchback, &ldquo;has anybody asked for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Lomaque; &ldquo;not a soul has entered the room. What sort of
      wine did you get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-so! Good at a pinch, friend&mdash;good at a pinch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you should go to my shop and try a certain cask, filled with a
      particular vintage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shop? Which vintage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop to tell you now; but we shall most likely meet again to-day.
      I expect to be at the prison this afternoon. Shall I ask for you? Good! I
      won&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo; With those farewell words he went out, and never so much as
      looked back at the prisoners before he closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine returned to his sister, fearful lest his face should betray what
      had passed during the extraordinary interview between Lomaque and himself.
      But, whatever change there might be in his expression, Rose did not seem
      to notice it. She was still strangely inattentive to all outward things.
      That spirit of resignation, which is the courage of women in all great
      emergencies, seemed now to be the one animating spirit that fed the flame
      of life within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her brother sat down by her, she only took his hand gently and said:
      &ldquo;Let us stop together like this, Louis, till the time comes. I am not
      afraid of it, for I have nothing but you to make me love life, and you,
      too, are going to die. Do you remember the time when I used to grieve that
      I had never had a child to be some comfort to me? I was thinking, a moment
      ago, how terrible it would have been now, if my wish had been granted. It
      is a blessing for me, in this great misery, that I am childless. Let us
      talk of old days, Louis, as long as we can&mdash;not of my husband; or my
      marriage&mdash;only of the old times, before I was a burden and a trouble
      to you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day wore on. By ones and twos and threes at a time, the condemned
      prisoners came from the tribunal, and collected in the waiting-room. At
      two o&rsquo;clock all was ready for the calling over of the death-list. It was
      read and verified by an officer of the court; and then the jailer took his
      prisoners back to St. Lazare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening came. The prisoners&rsquo; meal had been served; the duplicate of the
      death-list had been read in public at the grate; the cell doors were all
      locked. From the day of their arrest, Rose and her brother, partly through
      the influence of a bribe, partly through Lomaque&rsquo;s intercession, had been
      confined together in one cell; and together they now awaited the dread
      event of the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Rose that event was death&mdash;death, to the thought of which, at
      least, she was now resigned. To Trudaine the fast-nearing future was
      darkening hour by hour, with the uncertainty which is worse than death;
      with the faint, fearful, unpartaken suspense, which keeps the mind ever on
      the rack, and wears away the heart slowly. Through the long unsolaced
      agony of that dreadful night, but one relief came to him. The tension of
      every nerve, the crushing weight of the one fatal oppression that clung to
      every thought, relaxed a little when Rose&rsquo;s bodily powers began to sink
      under her mental exhaustion&mdash;when her sad, dying talk of the happy
      times that were passed ceased softly, and she laid her head on his
      shoulder, and let the angel of slumber take her yet for a little while,
      even though she lay already under the shadow of the angel of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning came, and the hot summer sunrise. What life was left in the
      terror-struck city awoke for the day faintly; and still the suspense of
      the long night remained unlightened. It was drawing near the hour when the
      tumbrils were to come for the victims doomed on the day before. Trudaine&rsquo;s
      ear could detect even the faintest sound in the echoing prison region
      outside his cell. Soon, listening near the door, he heard voices disputing
      on the other side of it. Suddenly, the bolts were drawn back, the key
      turned in the lock, and he found himself standing face to face with the
      hunchback and one of the subordinate attendants on the prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; muttered this last man sulkily, &ldquo;there they are, safe in their
      cell, just as I said; but I tell you again they are not down in the list.
      What do you mean by bullying me about not chalking their door, last night,
      along with the rest? Catch me doing your work for you again, when you&rsquo;re
      too drunk to do it yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, and let me have another look at the list!&rdquo; returned the
      hunchback, turning away from the cell door, and snatching a slip of paper
      from the other&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;The devil take me if I can make head or tail of
      it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, scratching his head, after a careful examination of the
      list. &ldquo;I could swear that I read over their names at the grate yesterday
      afternoon with my own lips; and yet, look as long as I may, I certainly
      can&rsquo;t find them written down here. Give us a pinch, friend. Am I awake, or
      dreaming? drunk or sober this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sober, I hope,&rdquo; said a quiet voice at his elbow. &ldquo;I have just looked in
      to see how you are after yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I am, Citizen Lomaque? Petrified with astonishment. You yourself took
      charge of that man and woman for me, in the waiting-room, yesterday
      morning; and as for myself, I could swear to having read their names at
      the grate yesterday afternoon. Yet this morning here are no such things as
      these said names to be found in the list! What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think,&rdquo; interrupted the aggrieved subordinate, &ldquo;of his
      having the impudence to bully me for being careless in chalking the doors,
      when he was too drunk to do it himself? too drunk to know his right hand
      from his left! If I wasn&rsquo;t the best-natured man in the world, I should
      report him to the head jailer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right of you to excuse him, and quite wrong of him to bully you,&rdquo;
       said Lomaque, persuasively. &ldquo;Take my advice,&rdquo; he continued,
      confidentially, to the hunchback, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t trust too implicitly to that
      slippery memory of yours, after our little drinking bout yesterday. You
      could not really have read their names at the grate, you know, or of
      course they would be down on the list. As for the waiting-room at the
      tribunal, a word in your ear: chief agents of police know strange secrets.
      The president of the court condemns and pardons in public; but there is
      somebody else, with the power of ten thousand presidents, who now and then
      condemns and pardons in private. You can guess who. I say no more, except
      that I recommend you to keep your head on your shoulders, by troubling it
      about nothing but the list there in your hand. Stick to that literally,
      and nobody can blame you. Make a fuss about mysteries that don&rsquo;t concern
      you, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque stopped, and holding his hand edgewise, let it drop significantly
      over the hunchback&rsquo;s head. That action and the hints which preceded it
      seemed to bewilder the little man more than ever. He stared perplexedly at
      Lomaque; uttered a word or two of rough apology to his subordinate, and
      rolling his misshapen head portentously, walked away with the death-list
      crumpled up nervously in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have a sight of them, and see if they really are the
      same man and woman whom I looked after yesterday morning in the
      waiting-room,&rdquo; said Lomaque, putting his hand on the cell door, just as
      the deputy-jailer was about to close it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look in, by all means,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;No doubt you will find that
      drunken booby as wrong in what he told you about them as he is about
      everything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque made use of the privilege granted to him immediately. He saw
      Trudaine sitting with his sister in the corner of the cell furthest from
      the door, evidently for the purpose of preventing her from overhearing the
      conversation outside. There was an unsettled look, however, in her eyes, a
      slowly-heightening color in her cheeks, which showed her to be at least
      vaguely aware that something unusual had been taking place in the
      corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque beckoned to Trudaine to leave her, and whispered to him: &ldquo;The
      prescription has worked well. You are safe for to-day. Break the news to
      your sister as gently as you can. Danville&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped and listened
      till he satisfied himself, by the sound of the deputy-jailer&rsquo;s footsteps,
      that the man was lounging toward the further end of the corridor.
      &ldquo;Danville,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;after having mixed with the people outside the
      grate yesterday, and having heard your names read, was arrested in the
      evening by secret order from Robespierre, and sent to the Temple. What
      charge will be laid to him, or when he will be brought to trial, it is
      impossible to say. I only know that he is arrested. Hush! don&rsquo;t talk now;
      my friend outside is coming back. Keep quiet&mdash;hope everything from
      the chances and changes of public affairs; and comfort yourself with the
      thought that you are both safe for to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to-morrow?&rdquo; whispered Trudaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of to-morrow,&rdquo; returned Lomaque, turning away hurriedly to
      the door &ldquo;Let to-morrow take care of itself.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 1.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On a spring morning, in the year seventeen hundred and ninety-eight, the
      public conveyance then running between Chalons-sur-Marne and Paris sat
      down one of its outside passengers at the first post-station beyond Meaux.
      The traveler, an old man, after looking about him hesitatingly for a
      moment or two, betook himself to a little inn opposite the post-house,
      known by the sign of the Piebald Horse, and kept by the Widow Duval&mdash;a
      woman who enjoyed and deserved the reputation of being the fastest talker
      and the best maker of <i>gibelotte</i> in the whole locality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the traveler was carelessly noticed by the village idlers, and
      received without ceremony by the Widow Duval, he was by no means so
      ordinary and uninteresting a stranger as the rustics of the place were
      pleased to consider him. The time had been when this quiet, elderly,
      unobtrusive applicant for refreshment at the Piebald House was trusted
      with the darkest secrets of the Reign of Terror, and was admitted at all
      times and seasons to speak face to face with Maximilian Robespierre
      himself. The Widow Duval and the hangers-on in front of the post-house
      would have been all astonished indeed if any well-informed personage from
      the metropolis had been present to tell them that the modest old traveler
      with the shabby little carpet-bag was an ex-chief agent of the secret
      police of Paris!
    </p>
    <p>
      Between three and four years had elapsed since Lomaque had exercised, for
      the last time, his official functions under the Reign of Terror. His
      shoulders had contracted an extra stoop, and his hair had all fallen off,
      except at the sides and back of his head. In some other respects, however,
      advancing age seemed to have improved rather than deteriorated him in
      personal appearance. His complexion looked healthier, his expression
      cheerfuller, his eyes brighter than they had ever been of late years. He
      walked, too, with a brisker step than the step of old times in the police
      office; and his dress, although it certainly did not look like the costume
      of a man in affluent circumstances, was cleaner and far more nearly worn
      than ever it had been in the past days of his political employment at
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down alone in the inn parlor, and occupied the time, while his
      hostess had gone to fetch the half-bottle of wine that he ordered, in
      examining a dirty old card which he extricated from a mass of papers in
      his pocket-book, and which bore, written on it, these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the troubles are over, do not forget those who remember you with
      eternal gratitude. Stop at the first post-station beyond Meaux, on the
      high-road to Paris, and ask at the inn for Citizen Maurice, whenever you
      wish to see us or to hear of us again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; inquired Lomaque, putting the card in his pocket when the Widow
      Duval brought in the wine, &ldquo;can you inform me whether a person named
      Maurice lives anywhere in this neighborhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I inform you?&rdquo; repeated the voluble widow. &ldquo;Of course I can! Citizen
      Maurice, and the citoyenne, his amiable sister&mdash;who is not to be
      passed over because you don&rsquo;t mention her, my honest man&mdash;lives
      within ten minutes&rsquo; walk of my house. A charming cottage, in a charming
      situation, inhabited by two charming people&mdash;so quiet, so retiring,
      such excellent pay. I supply them with everything&mdash;fowls, eggs,
      bread, butter, vegetables (not that they eat much of anything), wine
      (which they don&rsquo;t drink half enough of to do them good); in short, I
      victual the dear little hermitage, and love the two amiable recluses with
      all my heart. Ah! they have had their troubles, poor people, the sister
      especially, though they never talk about them. When they first came to
      live in our neighborhood&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, citoyenne, but if you would only be so kind as to direct me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is three&mdash;no, four&mdash;no, three years and a half ago&mdash;in
      short, just after the time when that Satan of a man, Robespierre, had his
      head cut off (and serve him right!), I said to my husband (who was on his
      last legs then, poor man!) &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll die&rsquo;&mdash;meaning the lady. She didn&rsquo;t
      though. My fowls, eggs, bread, butter, vegetables, and wine carried her
      through&mdash;always in combination with the anxious care of Citizen
      Maurice. Yes, yes! let us be tenderly conscientious in giving credit where
      credit is due; let us never forget that the citizen Maurice contributed
      something to the cure of the interesting invalid, as well as the victuals
      and drink from the Piebald Horse. There she is now, the prettiest little
      woman in the prettiest little cottage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Will you be so obliging as to tell me where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in excellent health, except that she is subject now and then to
      nervous attacks; having evidently, as I believe, been struck with some
      dreadful fright&mdash;most likely during that accursed time of the Terror;
      for they came from Paris&mdash;you don&rsquo;t drink, honest man! Why don&rsquo;t you
      drink? Very, very pretty in a pale way; figure perhaps too thin&mdash;let
      me pour it out for you&mdash;but an angel of gentleness, and attached in
      such a touching way to the citizen Maurice&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen hostess, will you, or will you not, tell me where they live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You droll little man, why did you not ask me that before, if you wanted
      to know? Finish your wine, and come to the door. There&rsquo;s your change, and
      thank you for your custom, though it isn&rsquo;t much. Come to the door, I say,
      and don&rsquo;t interrupt me! You&rsquo;re an old man&mdash;can you see forty yards
      before you? Yes, you can! Don&rsquo;t be peevish&mdash;that never did anybody
      any good yet. Now look back, along the road where I am pointing. You see a
      large heap of stones? Good. On the other side of the heap of stones there
      is a little path; you can&rsquo;t see that, but you can remember what I tell
      you? Good. You go down the path till you get to a stream; down the stream
      till you get to a bridge; down the other bank of the stream (after
      crossing the bridge) till you get to an old water-mill&mdash;a jewel of a
      water-mill, famous for miles round; artists from the four quarters of the
      globe are always coming to sketch it. Ah! what, you are getting peevish
      again? You won&rsquo;t wait? Impatient old man, what a life your wife must lead,
      if you have got one! Remember the bridge. Ah! your poor wife and children,
      I pity them; your daughters especially! Pst! pst! Remember the bridge&mdash;peevish
      old man, remember the bridge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walking as fast as he could out of hearing of the Widow Duval&rsquo;s tongue,
      Lomaque took the path by the heap of stones which led out of the
      high-road, crossed the stream, and arrived at the old water-mill. Close by
      it stood a cottage&mdash;a rough, simple building, with a strip of garden
      in front. Lomaque&rsquo;s observant eyes marked the graceful arrangement of the
      flower-beds, and the delicate whiteness of the curtains that hung behind
      the badly-glazed narrow windows. &ldquo;This must be the place,&rdquo; he said to
      himself, as he knocked at the door with his stick. &ldquo;I can see the traces
      of her hand before I cross the threshold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened. &ldquo;Pray, does the citizen Maurice&mdash;&rdquo; Lomaque
      began, not seeing clearly, for the first moment, in the dark little
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could say any more his hand was grasped, his carpet-bag was
      taken from him, and a well-known voice cried, &ldquo;Welcome! a thousand
      thousand times welcome, at last! Citizen Maurice is not at home; but Louis
      Trudaine takes his place, and is overjoyed to see once more the best and
      dearest of his friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know you again. How you are altered for the better!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Lomaque, as they entered the parlor of the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that you see me after a long freedom from anxiety. Since I have
      lived here, I have gone to rest at night, and have not been afraid of the
      morning,&rdquo; replied Trudaine. He went out into the passage while he spoke,
      and called at the foot of the one flight of stairs which the cottage
      possessed, &ldquo;Rose! Rose! come down! The friend whom you most wished to see
      has arrived at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered the summons immediately. The frank, friendly warmth of her
      greeting; her resolute determination, after the first inquiries were over,
      to help the guest to take off his upper coat with her own hands, so
      confused and delighted Lomaque, that he hardly knew which way to turn, or
      what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is even more trying, in a pleasant way, to a lonely old fellow like
      me,&rdquo; he was about to add, &ldquo;than the unexpected civility of the hot cup of
      coffee years ago&rdquo;; but remembering what recollections even that trifling
      circumstance might recall, he checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More trying than what?&rdquo; asked Rose, leading him to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I forget. I am in my dotage already!&rdquo; he answered, confusedly. &ldquo;I
      have not got used just yet to the pleasure of seeing your kind face
      again.&rdquo; It was indeed a pleasure to look at that face now, after Lomaque&rsquo;s
      last experience of it. Three years of repose, though they had not restored
      to Rose those youthful attractions which she had lost forever in the days
      of the Terror, had not passed without leaving kindly outward traces of
      their healing progress. Though the girlish roundness had not returned to
      her cheeks, or the girlish delicacy of color to her complexion, her eyes
      had recovered much of their old softness, and her expression all of its
      old winning charm. What was left of latent sadness in her face, and of
      significant quietness in her manner, remained gently and harmlessly&mdash;remained
      rather to show what had been once than what was now.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were all seated, there was, however, something like a momentary
      return to the suspense and anxiety of past days in their faces, as
      Trudaine, looking earnestly at Lomaque, asked, &ldquo;Do you bring any news from
      Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but excellent news, instead, from Rouen. I have
      heard, accidentally, through the employer whom I have been serving since
      we parted, that your old house by the river-side is to let again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose started from her chair. &ldquo;Oh, Louis, if we could only live there once
      more! My flower-garden?&rdquo; she continued to Lomaque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cultivated throughout,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;by the late proprietor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the laboratory?&rdquo; added her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left standing,&rdquo; said Lomaque. &ldquo;Here is a letter with all the particulars.
      You may depend upon them, for the writer is the person charged with the
      letting of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trudaine looked over the letter eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The price is not beyond our means,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After our three years&rsquo;
      economy here, we can afford to give something for a great pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a day of happiness it will be when we go home again!&rdquo; cried
      Rose. &ldquo;Pray write to your friend at once,&rdquo; she added, addressing Lomaque,
      &ldquo;and say we take the house, before any one else is beforehand with us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and folding up the letter mechanically in the old official
      form, made a note on it in the old official manner. Trudaine observed the
      action, and felt its association with past times of trouble and terror.
      His face grew grave again as he said to Lomaque, &ldquo;And is this good news
      really all the news of importance you have to tell us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque hesitated, and fidgeted in his chair. &ldquo;What other news I have will
      bear keeping,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There are many questions I should like to ask
      first, about your sister and yourself. Do you mind allowing me to refer
      for a moment to the time when we last met?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He addressed this inquiry to Rose, who answered in the negative; but her
      voice seemed to falter, even in saying the one word &ldquo;No.&rdquo; She turned her
      head away when she spoke; and Lomaque noticed that her hands trembled as
      she took up some work lying on a table near, and hurriedly occupied
      herself with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We speak as little about that time as possible,&rdquo; said Trudaine, looking
      significantly toward his sister; &ldquo;but we have some questions to ask you in
      our turn; so the allusion, for this once, is inevitable. Your sudden
      disappearance at the very crisis of that time of danger has not yet been
      fully explained to us. The one short note which you left behind you helped
      us to guess at what had happened rather than to understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can easily explain it now,&rdquo; answered Lomaque. &ldquo;The sudden overthrow of
      the Reign of Terror, which was salvation to you, was destruction to me.
      The new republican reign was a reign of mercy, except for the tail of
      Robespierre, as the phrase ran then. Every man who had been so wicked or
      so unfortunate as to be involved, even in the meanest capacity, with the
      machinery of the government of Terror, was threatened, and justly, with
      the fate of Robespierre. I, among others, fell under this menace of death.
      I deserved to die, and should have resigned myself to the guillotine but
      for you. From the course taken by public events, I knew you would be
      saved; and although your safety was the work of circumstances, still I had
      a hand in rendering it possible at the outset; and a yearning came over me
      to behold you both free again with my own eyes&mdash;a selfish yearning to
      see in you a living, breathing, real result of the one good impulse of my
      heart, which I could look back on with satisfaction. This desire gave me a
      new interest in life. I resolved to escape death if it were possible. For
      ten days I lay hidden in Paris. After that&mdash;thanks to certain scraps
      of useful knowledge which my experience in the office of secret police had
      given me&mdash;I succeeded in getting clear of Paris and in making my way
      safely to Switzerland. The rest of my story is so short and so soon told
      that I may as well get it over at once. The only relation I knew of in the
      world to apply to was a cousin of mine (whom I had never seen before),
      established as a silk-mercer at Berne. I threw myself on this man&rsquo;s mercy.
      He discovered that I was likely, with my business habits, to be of some
      use to him, and he took me into his house. I worked for what he pleased to
      give me, traveled about for him in Switzerland, deserved his confidence,
      and won it. Till within the last few months I remained with him; and only
      left my employment to enter, by my master&rsquo;s own desire, the house of his
      brother, established also as a silk-mercer, at Chalons-sur-Marne. In the
      counting-house of this merchant I am corresponding clerk, and am only able
      to come and see you now by offering to undertake a special business
      mission for my employer at Paris. It is drudgery, at my time of life,
      after all I have gone through&mdash;but my hard work is innocent work. I
      am not obliged to cringe for every crown-piece I put in my pocket&mdash;not
      bound to denounce, deceive, and dog to death other men, before I can earn
      my bread, and scrape together money enough to bury me. I am ending a bad,
      base life harmlessly at last. It is a poor thing to do, but it is
      something done&mdash;and even that contents a man at my age. In short, I
      am happier than I used to be, or at least less ashamed when I look people
      like you in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; interrupted Rose, laying her hand on his arm. &ldquo;I cannot
      allow you to talk of yourself in that way, even in jest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was speaking in earnest,&rdquo; answered Lomaque, quietly; &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t weary
      you with any more words about myself. My story is told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All?&rdquo; asked Trudaine. He looked searchingly, almost suspiciously, at
      Lomaque, as he put the question. &ldquo;All?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Yours is a short
      story, indeed, my good friend! Perhaps you have forgotten some of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Lomaque fidgeted and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not a little hard on an old man to be always asking questions of
      him, and never answering one of his inquiries in return?&rdquo; he said to Rose,
      very gayly as to manner, but rather uneasily as to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not speak out till we two are alone,&rdquo; thought Trudaine. &ldquo;It is
      best to risk nothing, and to humor him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; he said aloud; &ldquo;no grumbling. I admit that it is your turn
      to hear our story now; and I will do my best to gratify you. But before I
      begin,&rdquo; he added, turning to his sister, &ldquo;let me suggest, Rose, that if
      you have any household matters to settle upstairs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; she interrupted, hurriedly, taking up the work
      which, during the last few minutes, she had allowed to drop into her lap;
      &ldquo;but I am stronger than you think; I can face the worst of our
      recollections composedly. Go on, Louis; pray go on&mdash;I am quite fit to
      stop and hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what we suffered in the first days of our suspense, after the
      success of your stratagem,&rdquo; said Trudaine, turning to Lomaque. &ldquo;I think it
      was on the evening after we had seen you for the last time at St. Lazare
      that strange, confused rumors of an impending convulsion in Paris first
      penetrated within our prison walls. During the next few days the faces of
      our jailers were enough to show us that those rumors were true, and that
      the Reign of Terror was actually threatened with overthrow at the hands of
      the Moderate Party. We had hardly time to hope everything from this
      blessed change before the tremendous news of Robespierre&rsquo;s attempted
      suicide, then of his condemnation and execution, reached us. The confusion
      produced in the prison was beyond all description. The accused who had
      been tried and the accused who had not been tried got mingled together.
      From the day of Robespierre&rsquo;s arrest, no orders came to the authorities,
      no death-lists reached the prison. The jailers, terrified by rumors that
      the lowest accomplices of the tyrant would be held responsible, and be
      condemned with him, made no attempt to maintain order. Some of them&mdash;that
      hunchback man among the rest&mdash;deserted their duties altogether. The
      disorganization was so complete, that when the commissioners from the new
      Government came to St. Lazare, some of us were actually half starving from
      want of the bare necessities of life. To inquire separately into our cases
      was found to be impossible. Sometimes the necessary papers were lost;
      sometimes what documents remained were incomprehensible to the new
      commissioners. They were obliged, at last, to make short work of it by
      calling us up before them in dozens. Tried or not tried, we had all been
      arrested by the tyrant, had all been accused of conspiracy against him,
      and were all ready to hail the new Government as the salvation of France.
      In nine cases out of ten, our best claim to be discharged was derived from
      these circumstances. We were trusted by Tallien and the men of the Ninth
      Thermidor, because we had been suspected by Robespierre, Couthon, and St.
      Just. Arrested informally, we were now liberated informally. When it came
      to my sister&rsquo;s turn and mine, we were not under examination five minutes.
      No such thing as a searching question was asked of us; I believe we might
      even have given our own names with perfect impunity. But I had previously
      instructed Rose that we were to assume our mother&rsquo;s maiden name&mdash;Maurice.
      As the citizen and citoyenne Maurice, accordingly, we passed out of prison&mdash;under
      the same name we have lived ever since in hiding here. Our past repose has
      depended, our future happiness will depend, on our escape from death being
      kept the profoundest secret among us three. For one all sufficient reason,
      which you can easily guess at, the brother and sister Maurice must still
      know nothing of Louis Trudaine and Rose Danville, except that they were
      two among the hundreds of victims guillotined during the Reign of Terror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke the last sentence with a faint smile, and with the air of a man
      trying, in spite of himself, to treat a grave subject lightly. His face
      clouded again, however, in a moment, when he looked toward his sister, as
      he ceased. Her work had once more dropped on her lap, her face was turned
      away so that he could not see it; but he knew by the trembling of her
      clasped hands, as they rested on her knee, and by the slight swelling of
      the veins on her neck which she could not hide from him, that her boasted
      strength of nerve had deserted her. Three years of repose had not yet
      enabled her to hear her marriage name uttered, or to be present when past
      times of deathly suffering and terror were referred to, without betraying
      the shock in her face and manner. Trudaine looked saddened, but in no way
      surprised by what he saw. Making a sign to Lomaque to say nothing, he rose
      and took up his sister&rsquo;s hood, which lay on a window-seat near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Rose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the sun is shining, the sweet spring air is
      inviting us out. Let us have a quiet stroll along the banks of the stream.
      Why should we keep our good friend here cooped up in this narrow little
      room, when we have miles and miles of beautiful landscape to show him on
      the other side of the threshold? Come, it is high treason to Queen Nature
      to remain indoors on such a morning as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for her to reply, he put on her hood, drew her arm through
      his, and led the way out. Lomaque&rsquo;s face grew grave as he followed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad I only showed the bright side of my budget of news in her
      presence,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;She is not well at heart yet. I might have hurt
      her, poor thing! I might have hurt her again sadly, if I had not held my
      tongue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked for a little while down the banks of the stream, talking of
      indifferent matters; then returned to the cottage. By that time Rose had
      recovered her spirits, and could listen with interest and amusement to
      Lomaque&rsquo;s dryly-humorous description of his life as a clerk at
      Chalons-sur-Marne. They parted for a little while at the cottage door.
      Rose retired to the upstairs room from which she had been summoned by her
      brother. Trudaine and Lomaque returned to wander again along the banks of
      the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one accord, and without a word passing between them, they left the
      neighborhood of the cottage hurriedly; then stopped on a sudden, and
      attentively looked each other in the face&mdash;looked in silence for an
      instant. Trudaine spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for having spared her,&rdquo; he began, abruptly. &ldquo;She is not
      strong enough yet to bear hearing of a new misfortune, unless I break the
      tidings to her first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suspect me, then, of bringing bad news?&rdquo; said Lomaque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you do. When I saw your first look at her, after we were all
      seated in the cottage parlor, I knew it. Speak without fear, without
      caution, without one useless word of preface. After three years of repose,
      if it pleases God to afflict us again, I can bear the trial calmly; and,
      if need be, can strengthen her to bear it calmly, too. I say again,
      Lomaque, speak at once, and speak out! I know your news is bad, for I know
      beforehand that it is news of Danville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; my bad news is news of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has discovered the secret of our escape from the guillotine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;he has not a suspicion of it. He believes&mdash;as his mother,
      as every one does&mdash;that you were both executed the day after the
      Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced you to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lomaque, you speak positively of that belief of his&mdash;but you cannot
      be certain of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can, on the most indisputable, the most startling evidence&mdash;on the
      authority of Danville&rsquo;s own act. You have asked me to speak out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you again&mdash;I insist on it! Your news, Lomaque&mdash;your news,
      without another word of preface!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it without another word of preface. Danville is on the
      point of being married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the answer was given they both stopped by the bank of the stream, and
      again looked each other in the face. There was a minute of dead silence
      between them. During that minute, the water bubbling by happily over its
      bed of pebbles seemed strangely loud, the singing of birds in a little
      wood by the stream-side strangely near and shrill, in both their ears. The
      light breeze, for all its midday warmth, touched their cheeks coldly; and
      the spring sunlight pouring on their faces felt as if it were glimmering
      on them through winter clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us walk on,&rdquo; said Trudaine, in a low voice. &ldquo;I was prepared for bad
      news, yet not for that. Are you certain of what you have just told me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As certain as that the stream here is flowing by our side. Hear how I
      made the discovery, and you will doubt no longer. Before last week I knew
      nothing of Danville, except that his arrest on suspicion by Robespierre&rsquo;s
      order was, as events turned out, the saving of his life. He was
      imprisoned, as I told you, on the evening after he had heard your names
      read from the death-list at the prison grate. He remained in confinement
      at the Temple, unnoticed in the political confusion out-of-doors, just as
      you remained unnoticed at St. Lazare, and he profited precisely in the
      same manner that you profited by the timely insurrection which overthrew
      the Reign of Terror. I knew this, and I knew that he walked out of prison
      in the character of a persecuted victim of Robespierre&rsquo;s&mdash;and, for
      better than three years past, I knew no more. Now listen. Last week I
      happened to be waiting in the shop of my employer, Citizen Clairfait, for
      some papers to take into the counting-house, when an old man enters with a
      sealed parcel, which he hands to one of the shopmen, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Give that to Citizen Clairfait.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Any name?&rsquo; says the shopman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The name is of no consequence,&rsquo; answers the old man; &lsquo;but if you please,
      you can give mine. Say the parcel came from Citizen Dubois;&rsquo; and then he
      goes out. His name, in connection with his elderly look, strikes me
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Does that old fellow live at Chalons?&rsquo; I ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; says the shopman. &lsquo;He is here in attendance on a customer of ours&mdash;an
      old ex-aristocrat named Danville. She is on a visit in our town.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave you to imagine how that reply startles and amazes me. The shopman
      can answer none of the other questions I put to him; but the next day I am
      asked to dinner by my employer (who, for his brother&rsquo;s sake, shows me the
      utmost civility). On entering the room, I find his daughter just putting
      away a lavender-colored silk scarf, on which she has been embroidering in
      silver what looks to me very like a crest and coat-of-arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind your seeing what I am about, Citizen Lomaque,&rsquo; says she;
      &lsquo;for I know my father can trust you. That scarf is sent back to us by the
      purchaser, an ex-emigrant lady of the old aristocratic school, to have her
      family coat-of-arms embroidered on it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Rather a dangerous commission even in these mercifully democratic times,
      is it not?&rsquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The old lady, you must know,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;is as proud as Lucifer; and
      having got back safely to France in these days of moderate republicanism,
      thinks she may now indulge with impunity in all her old-fashioned notions.
      She has been an excellent customer of ours, so my father thought it best
      to humor her, without, however, trusting her commission to any of the
      workroom women to execute. We are not living under the Reign of Terror
      now, certainly; still there is nothing like being on the safe side.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; I answer. &lsquo;Pray what is this ex-emigrant&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Danville,&rsquo; replies the citoyenne Clairfait. &lsquo;She is going to appear in
      that fine scarf at her son&rsquo;s marriage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Marriage!&rsquo; I exclaim, perfectly thunderstruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;What is there so amazing in that? By all accounts, the
      son, poor man, deserves to make a lucky marriage this time. His first wife
      was taken away from him in the Reign of Terror by the guillotine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who is he going to marry?&rsquo; I inquire, still breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The daughter of General Berthelin&mdash;an ex-aristocrat by family, like
      the old lady; but by principle as good a republican as ever lived&mdash;a
      hard-drinking, loud-swearing, big-whiskered old soldier, who snaps his
      fingers at his ancestors and says we are all descended from Adam, the
      first genuine sans-culotte in the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this way the citoyenne Clairfait gossips on all dinner-time, but says
      nothing more of any importance. I, with my old police-office habits, set
      to the next day, and try to make some discoveries for myself. The sum of
      what I find out is this: Danville&rsquo;s mother is staying with General
      Berthelin&rsquo;s sister and daughter at Chalons, and Danville himself is
      expected to arrive every day to escort them all three to Paris, where the
      marriage-contract is to be signed at the general&rsquo;s house. Discovering
      this, and seeing that prompt action is now of the most vital importance, I
      undertake, as I told you, my employer&rsquo;s commission for Paris, depart with
      all speed, and stop here on my way. Wait! I have not done yet. All the
      haste I can make is not haste enough to give me a good start of the
      wedding party. On my road here, the diligence by which I travel is passed
      by a carriage, posting along at full speed. I cannot see inside that
      carriage; but I look at the box-seat, and recognize on it the old man
      Dubois. He whirls by in a cloud of dust, but I am certain of him; and I
      say to myself what I now say again to you, no time is to be lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No time <i>shall</i> be lost,&rdquo; answers, Trudaine, firmly. &ldquo;Three years
      have passed,&rdquo; he continued, in a lower voice, speaking to himself rather
      than to Lomaque; &ldquo;three years since the day when I led my sister out of
      the gates of the prison&mdash;three years since I said in my heart, &lsquo;I
      will be patient, and will not seek to avenge myself. Our wrongs cry from
      earth to heaven; from man who inflicts to God who redresses. When the day
      of reckoning comes, let it be the day of his vengeance, not of mine.&rsquo; In
      my heart I said those words&mdash;I have been true to them&mdash;I have
      waited. The day has come, and the duty it demands of me shall be
      fulfilled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence before Lomaque spoke again. &ldquo;Your sister?&rdquo; he
      began, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is there only that my purpose falters,&rdquo; said the other, earnestly. &ldquo;If
      it were but possible to spare her all knowledge of this last trial, and to
      leave the accomplishment of the terrible task to me alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is possible,&rdquo; interposed Lomaque. &ldquo;Listen to what I advise. We
      must depart for Paris by the diligence to-morrow morning, and we must take
      your sister with us&mdash;to-morrow will be time enough; people don&rsquo;t sign
      marriage-contracts on the evening after a long day&rsquo;s journey. We must go
      then, and we must take your sister. Leave the care of her in Paris, and
      the responsibility of keeping her in ignorance of what you are doing, to
      me. Go to this General Berthelin&rsquo;s house at a time when you know Danville
      is there (we can get that knowledge through the servants); confront him
      without a moment&rsquo;s previous warning; confront him as a man risen from the
      dead; confront him before every soul in the room though the room should be
      full of people&mdash;and leave the rest to the self-betrayal of a
      panic-stricken man. Say but three words, and your duty will be done; you
      may return to your sister, and may depart with her in safety to your old
      retreat at Rouen, or where else you please, on the very day when you have
      put it out of her infamous husband&rsquo;s power to add another to the list of
      his crimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget the suddenness of the journey to Paris,&rdquo; said Trudaine. &ldquo;How
      are we to account for it without the risk of awakening my sister&rsquo;s
      suspicions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust that to me,&rdquo; answered Lomaque. &ldquo;Let us return to the cottage at
      once. No, not you,&rdquo; he added, suddenly, as they turned to retrace their
      steps. &ldquo;There is that in your face which would betray us. Leave me to go
      back alone&mdash;I will say that you have gone to give some orders at the
      inn. Let us separate immediately. You will recover your self-possession&mdash;you
      will get to look yourself again sooner&mdash;if you are left alone. I know
      enough of you to know that. We will not waste another minute in
      explanations; even minutes are precious to us on such a day as this. By
      the time you are fit to meet your sister again, I shall have had time to
      say all I wish to her, and shall be waiting at the cottage to tell you the
      result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Trudaine, and his eyes seemed to brighten again with
      something of the old energy and sudden decision of the days when he was a
      man in office under the Reign of Terror. &ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; he said; and,
      waving his hand, turned away quickly in the direction of the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly an hour passed before Trudaine ventured to follow him. When he at
      length entered the path which led to the garden gate, he saw his sister
      waiting at the cottage door. Her face looked unusually animated; and she
      ran forward a step or two to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Louis!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have a confession to make, and I must beg you to
      hear it patiently to the end. You must know that our good Lomaque, though
      he came in tired from his walk, occupied himself the first thing, at my
      request, in writing the letter which is to secure to us our dear old home
      by the banks of the Seine. When he had done, he looked at me, and said, &lsquo;I
      should like to be present at your happy return to the house where I first
      saw you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, come, come with us!&rsquo; I said directly. &lsquo;I am not an
      independent man,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;I have a margin of time allowed me at
      Paris, certainly, but it is not long&mdash;if I were only my own master&mdash;&rsquo;
      and then he stopped. Louis, I remembered all we owed to him; I remembered
      that there was no sacrifice we ought not to be too glad to make for his
      sake; I felt the kindness of the wish he had expressed; and perhaps I was
      a little influenced by my own impatience to see once more my flower-garden
      and the rooms where we used to be so happy. So I said to him, &lsquo;I am sure
      Louis will agree with me that our time is yours, and that we shall be only
      too glad to advance our departure so as to make traveling leisure enough
      for you to come with us to Rouen. We should be worse than ungrateful&mdash;&rsquo;
      He stopped me. &lsquo;You have always been good to me,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I must not
      impose on your kindness now. No, no, you have formalities to settle before
      you can leave this place.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not one,&rsquo; I said&mdash;for we have not, as you
      know, Louis? &lsquo;Why, here is your furniture to begin with,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;A few
      chairs and tables hired from the inn,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;we have only to give
      the landlady our key, to leave a letter for the owner of the cottage, and
      then&mdash;&rsquo; He laughed. &lsquo;Why, to hear you talk, one would think you were
      as ready to travel as I am!&rsquo; &lsquo;So we are,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;quite as ready, living
      in the way we do here.&rsquo; He shook his head; but you will not shake yours,
      Louis, I am sure, now you have heard all my long story? You can&rsquo;t blame me
      can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Trudaine could answer, Lomaque looked out of the cottage window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just been telling my brother every thing,&rdquo; said Rose, turning
      round toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does he say?&rdquo; asked Lomaque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says what I say,&rdquo; replied Rose, answering for her brother; &ldquo;that our
      time is your time&mdash;the time of our best and dearest friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall it be done, then?&rdquo; asked Lomaque, with a meaning look at Trudaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose glanced anxiously at her brother; his face was much graver than she
      had expected to see it, but his answer relieved her from all suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, love, to speak as you did,&rdquo; he said, gently. Then,
      turning to Lomaque, he added, in a firmer voice, &ldquo;It shall be done!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days after the traveling-carriage described by Lomaque had passed the
      diligence on the road to Paris, Madame Danville sat in the drawing-room of
      an apartment in the Rue de Grenelle, handsomely dressed for driving out.
      After consulting a large gold watch that hung at her side, and finding
      that it wanted a quarter of an hour only to two o&rsquo;clock, she rang her
      hand-bell, and said to the maid-servant who answered the summons, &ldquo;I have
      five minutes to spare. Send Dubois here with my chocolate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man made his appearance with great alacrity. After handing the cup
      of chocolate to his mistress, he ventured to use the privilege of talking,
      to which his long and faithful services entitled him, and paid the old
      lady a compliment. &ldquo;I am rejoiced to see madame looking so young and in
      such good spirits this morning,&rdquo; he said, with a low bow and a mild,
      deferential smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have some reason for being in good spirits on the day when my
      son&rsquo;s marriage-contract is to be signed,&rdquo; said Madame Danville, with a
      gracious nod of the head. &ldquo;Ha, Dubois, I shall live yet to see him with a
      patent of nobility in his hand. The mob has done its worst; the end of
      this infamous revolution is not far off; our order will have its turn
      again soon, and then who will have such a chance at court as my son? He is
      noble already through his mother, he will then be noble also through his
      wife. Yes, yes; let that coarse-mannered, passionate, old soldier-father
      of hers be as unnaturally republican as he pleases, he has inherited a
      name which will help my son to a peerage! The Vicomte D&rsquo;Anville (D with an
      apostrophe, Dubois, you understand?), the Vicomte D&rsquo;Anville&mdash;how
      prettily it sounds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmingly, madame&mdash;charmingly. Ah! this second marriage of my young
      master&rsquo;s begins under much better auspices than the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark was an unfortunate one. Madame Danville frowned portentously,
      and rose in a great hurry from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are your wits failing you, you old fool?&rdquo; she exclaimed, indignantly.
      &ldquo;What do you mean by referring to such a subject as that, on this day, of
      all others? You are always harping on those two wretched people who were
      guillotined, as if you thought I could have saved their lives. Were you
      not present when my son and I met, after the time of the Terror? Did you
      not hear my first words to him, when he told me of the catastrophe? Were
      they not &lsquo;Charles, I love you; but if I thought you had let those two
      unfortunates, who risked themselves to save me, die without risking your
      life in return to save them, I would break my heart rather than ever look
      at you or speak to you again!&rsquo; Did I not say that? And did he not answer,
      &lsquo;Mother, my life was risked for them. I proved my devotion by exposing
      myself to arrest&mdash;I was imprisoned for my exertions&mdash;and then I
      could do no more!&rsquo; Did you not stand by and hear him give that answer,
      overwhelmed while he spoke by generous emotion? Do you not know that he
      really was imprisoned in the Temple? Do you dare to think that we are to
      blame after that? I owe you much, Dubois, but if you are to take liberties
      with me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame! I beg pardon a thousand times. I was thoughtless&mdash;only
      thoughtless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! Is my coach at the door? Very well. Get ready to accompany me.
      Your master will not have time to return here. He will meet me, for the
      signing of the contract, at General Berthelin&rsquo;s house at two precisely.
      Stop! Are there many people in the street? I can&rsquo;t be stared at by the mob
      as I go to my carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dubois hobbled penitently to the window and looked out, while his mistress
      walked to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The street is almost empty, madame,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only a man with a woman on
      his arm, stopping and admiring your carriage. They seem like decent
      people, as well as I can tell without my spectacles. Not mob, I should
      say, madame; certainly not mob!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Attend me downstairs; and bring some loose silver with you, in
      case those two decent people should be fit objects for charity. No orders
      for the coachman, except that he is to go straight to the general&rsquo;s
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party assembled at General Berthelin&rsquo;s to witness the signature of the
      marriage-contract, comprised, besides the persons immediately interested
      in the ceremony of the day, some young ladies, friends of the bride, and a
      few officers, who had been comrades of her father&rsquo;s in past years. The
      guests were distributed, rather unequally, in two handsome apartments
      opening into each other&mdash;one called in the house the drawing-room,
      and the other the library. In the drawing-room were assembled the notary,
      with the contract ready, the bride, the young ladies, and the majority of
      General Berthelin&rsquo;s friends. In the library, the remainder of the military
      guests were amusing themselves at a billiard-table until the signing of
      the contract should take place, while Danville and his future
      father-in-law walked up and down the room together, the first listening
      absently, the last talking with all his accustomed energy, and with more
      than his accustomed allowance of barrack-room expletives. The general had
      taken it into his head to explain some of the clauses in the
      marriage-contract to the bridegroom, who, though far better acquainted
      with their full scope and meaning than his father-in-law, was obliged to
      listen for civility&rsquo;s sake. While the old soldier was still in the midst
      of his long and confused harangue, a clock struck on the library
      mantel-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; exclaimed Danville, glad of any pretext for interrupting
      the talk about the contract. &ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock; and my mother not here yet!
      What can be delaying her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; cried the general. &ldquo;When did you ever know a woman punctual, my
      lad? If we wait for your mother&mdash;and she&rsquo;s such a rabid aristocrat
      that she would never forgive us for not waiting&mdash;we shan&rsquo;t sign the
      contract yet this half-hour. Never mind! let&rsquo;s go on with what we were
      talking about. Where the devil was I when that cursed clock struck and
      interrupted us? Now then, Black Eyes, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last question was addressed to Mademoiselle Berthelin, who at that
      moment hastily entered the library from the drawing-room. She was a tall
      and rather masculine-looking girl, with superb black eyes, dark hair
      growing low on her forehead, and something of her father&rsquo;s decision and
      bluntness in her manner of speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stranger in the other room, papa, who wants to see you. I suppose the
      servants showed him upstairs, thinking he was one of the guests. Ought I
      to have had him shown down again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice question! How should I know? Wait till I have seen him, miss, and
      then I&rsquo;ll tell you!&rdquo; With these words the general turned on his heel, and
      went into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter would have followed him, but Danville caught her by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you be hard-hearted enough to leave me here alone?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to become of all my bosom friends in the next room, you selfish
      man, if I stop here with you?&rdquo; retorted mademoiselle, struggling to free
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call them in here,&rdquo; said Danville gayly, making himself master of her
      other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and drew him away toward the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and let all the ladies see what a tyrant I am going to
      marry. Come, and show them what an obstinate, unreasonable, wearisome&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice suddenly failed her; she shuddered, and turned faint. Danville&rsquo;s
      hand had in one instant grown cold as death in hers; the momentary touch
      of his fingers, as she felt their grasp loosen, struck some mysterious
      chill through her from head to foot. She glanced round at him
      affrightedly, and saw his eyes looking straight into the drawing-room.
      They were fixed in a strange, unwavering, awful stare, while, from the
      rest of his face, all expression, all character, all recognizable play and
      movement of feature, had utterly gone. It was a breathless, lifeless mask&mdash;a
      white blank. With a cry of terror, she looked where he seemed to be
      looking; and could see nothing but the stranger standing in the middle of
      the drawing-room. Before she could ask a question&mdash;before she could
      speak even a single word&mdash;her father came to her, caught Danville by
      the arm, and pushed her roughly back into the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go there, and take the women with you,&rdquo; he said, in a quick, fierce
      whisper. &ldquo;Into the library!&rdquo; he continued, turning to the ladies, and
      raising his voice. &ldquo;Into the library, all of you, along with my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women, terrified by his manner, obeyed him in the greatest confusion.
      As they hurried past him into the library, he signed to the notary to
      follow; and then closed the door of communication between the two rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop where you are!&rdquo; he cried, addressing the old officers, who had risen
      from their chairs. &ldquo;Stay, I insist on it! Whatever happens, Jacques
      Berthelin has done nothing to be ashamed of in the presence of his old
      friends and companions. You have seen the beginning, now stay and see the
      end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, he walked into the middle of the room. He had never
      quitted his hold of Danville&rsquo;s arm; step by step they advanced together to
      the place where Trudaine was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come into my house, and asked me for my daughter in marriage&mdash;and
      I have given her to you,&rdquo; said the general, addressing Danville, quietly.
      &ldquo;You told me that your first wife and her brother were guillotined three
      years ago in the time of the Terror&mdash;and I believed you. Now look at
      that man&mdash;look him straight in the face. He has announced himself to
      me as the brother of your wife, and he asserts that his sister is alive at
      this moment. One of you two has deceived me. Which is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danville tried to speak, but no sound passed his lips; tried to wrench his
      arm from the grasp that was on it, but could not stir the old soldier&rsquo;s
      steady hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid? are you a coward? Can&rsquo;t you look him in the face?&rdquo; asked
      the general, tightening his hold sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; interposed one of the old officers, coming forward. &ldquo;Give
      him time. This may be a case of strange accidental resemblance, which
      would be enough, under the circumstances, to discompose any man. You will
      excuse me, citizen,&rdquo; he continued, turning to Trudaine; &ldquo;but you are a
      stranger. You have given us no proof of your identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the proof,&rdquo; said Trudaine, pointing to Danville&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; pursued the other; &ldquo;he looks pale and startled enough,
      certainly. But I say again, let us not be too hasty; there are strange
      cases on record of accidental resemblances, and this may be one of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he repeated those words, Danville looked at him with a faint, cringing
      gratitude, stealing slowly over the blank terror of his face. He bowed his
      head, murmured something, and gesticulated confusedly with the hand that
      he was free to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried the old officer; &ldquo;look, Berthelin; he denies the man&rsquo;s
      identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; said the general, appealing to Trudaine. &ldquo;Have you
      proofs to confute him? If you have, produce them instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the answer could be given the door leading into the drawing-room
      from the staircase was violently flung open, and Madame Danville&mdash;her
      hair in disorder, her face in its colorless terror looking like the very
      counterpart of her son&rsquo;s&mdash;appeared on the threshold, with the old man
      Dubois and a group of amazed and startled servants behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t sign! for God&rsquo;s sake, come away!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
      have seen your wife&mdash;in the spirit, or in the flesh, I know not which&mdash;but
      I have seen her. Charles! Charles! as true as Heaven is above us, I have
      seen your wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen her in the flesh, living and breathing as you see her
      brother yonder,&rdquo; said a firm, quiet voice, from among the servants on the
      landing outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that man enter, whoever he is!&rdquo; cried the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lomaque passed Madame Danville on the threshold. She trembled as he
      brushed by her; then, supporting herself by the wall, followed him a few
      paces into the room. She looked first at her son&mdash;after that, at
      Trudaine&mdash;after that back again at her son. Something in her presence
      silenced every one. There fell a sudden stillness over all the assembly&mdash;a
      stillness so deep that the eager, frightened whispering, and sharp
      rustling of dresses among the women in the library, became audible from
      the other side of the closed door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; she said, slowly advancing; &ldquo;why do you look&mdash;&rdquo; She
      stopped, and fixed her eyes again on her son more earnestly than before;
      then turned them suddenly on Trudaine. &ldquo;You are looking at my son, sir,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;and I see contempt in your face. By what right do you insult a
      man whose grateful sense of his mother&rsquo;s obligations to you made him risk
      his life for the saving of yours and your sister&rsquo;s? By what right have you
      kept the escape of my son&rsquo;s wife from death by the guillotine&mdash;an
      escape which, for all I know to the contrary, his generous exertions were
      instrumental in effecting&mdash;a secret from my son? By what right, I
      demand to know, has your treacherous secrecy placed us in such a position
      as we now stand in before the master of this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of sorrow and pity passed over Trudaine&rsquo;s face while she
      spoke. He retired a few steps, and gave her no answer. The general looked
      at him with eager curiosity, and, dropping his hold of Danville&rsquo;s arm,
      seemed about to speak; but Lomaque stepped forward at the same time, and
      held up his hand to claim attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall express the wishes of Citizen Trudaine,&rdquo; he said,
      addressing Madame Danville, &ldquo;if I recommend this lady not to press for too
      public an answer to her questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray who are you, sir, who take it on yourself to advise me?&rdquo; she
      retorted, haughtily. &ldquo;I have nothing to say to you, except that I repeat
      those questions, and that I insist on their being answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this man?&rdquo; asked the general, addressing Trudaine, and pointing to
      Lomaque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man unworthy of credit,&rdquo; cried Danville, speaking audibly for the first
      time, and darting a look of deadly hatred at Lomaque. &ldquo;An agent of police
      under Robespierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in that capacity capable of answering questions which refer to the
      transactions of Robespierre&rsquo;s tribunals,&rdquo; remarked the ex-chief agent,
      with his old official self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; exclaimed the general; &ldquo;the man is right&mdash;let him be heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no help for it,&rdquo; said Lomaque, looking at Trudaine; &ldquo;leave it to
      me&mdash;it is fittest that I should speak. I was present,&rdquo; he continued,
      in a louder voice, &ldquo;at the trial of Citizen Trudaine and his sister. They
      were brought to the bar through the denunciation of Citizen Danville. Till
      the confession of the male prisoner exposed the fact, I can answer for
      Danville&rsquo;s not being aware of the real nature of the offenses charged
      against Trudaine and his sister. When it became known that they had been
      secretly helping this lady to escape from France, and when Danville&rsquo;s own
      head was consequently in danger, I myself heard him save it by a false
      assertion that he had been aware of Trudaine&rsquo;s conspiracy from the first&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; interrupted the general, &ldquo;that he proclaimed himself
      in open court as having knowingly denounced the man who was on trial for
      saving his mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered Lomaque. (A murmur of horror and indignation rose from
      all the strangers present at that reply.) &ldquo;The reports of the Tribunal are
      existing to prove the truth of what I say,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;As to the escape
      of Citizen Trudaine and the wife of Danville from the guillotine, it was
      the work of political circumstances, which there are persons living to
      speak to if necessary; and of a little stratagem of mine, which need not
      be referred to now. And, last, with reference to the concealment which
      followed the escape, I beg to inform you that it was abandoned the moment
      we knew of what was going on here; and that it was only persevered in up
      to this time, as a natural measure of precaution on the part of Citizen
      Trudaine. From a similar motive we now abstain from exposing his sister to
      the shock and the peril of being present here. What man with an atom of
      feeling would risk letting her even look again on such a husband as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced round him, and pointed to Danville, as he put the question.
      Before a word could be spoken by any one else in the room, a low wailing
      cry of &ldquo;My mistress! my dear, dear mistress!&rdquo; directed all eyes first on
      the old man Dubois, then on Madame Danville.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been leaning against the wall, before Lomaque began to speak; but
      she stood perfectly upright now. She neither spoke nor moved. Not one of
      the light gaudy ribbons flaunting on her disordered head-dress so much as
      trembled. The old servant Dubois was crouched on his knees at her side,
      kissing her cold right hand, chafing it in his, reiterating his faint,
      mournful cry, &ldquo;Oh! my mistress! my dear, dear mistress!&rdquo; but she did not
      appear to know that he was near her. It was only when her son advanced a
      step or two toward her that she seemed to awaken suddenly from that
      death-trance of mental pain. Then she slowly raised the hand that was
      free, and waved him back from her. He stopped in obedience to the gesture,
      and endeavored to speak. She waved her hand again, and the deathly
      stillness of her face began to grow troubled. Her lips moved a little&mdash;she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oblige me, sir, for the last time, by keeping silence. You and I have
      henceforth nothing to say to each other. I am the daughter of a race of
      nobles, and the widow of a man of honor. You are a traitor and a false
      witness&mdash;a thing from which all true men and true women turn with
      contempt. I renounce you! Publicly, in the presence of these gentlemen, I
      say it&mdash;I have no son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her back on him; and, bowing to the other persons in the room
      with the old formal courtesy of by-gone times, walked slowly and steadily
      to the door. Stopping there, she looked back; and then the artificial
      courage of the moment failed her. With a faint, suppressed cry she
      clutched at the hand of the old servant, who still kept faithfully at her
      side; he caught her in his arms, and her head sank on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help him!&rdquo; cried the general to the servants near the door. &ldquo;Help him to
      take her into the next room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked up suspiciously from his mistress to the persons who
      were assisting him to support her. With a strange, sudden jealousy he
      shook his hand at them. &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;she shall go home, and I will
      take care of her. Away! you there&mdash;nobody holds her head but Dubois.
      Downstairs! downstairs to her carriage! She has nobody but me now, and I
      say that she shall be taken home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed, General Berthelin approached Trudaine, who had stood
      silent and apart, from the time when Lomaque first appeared in the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to ask your pardon,&rdquo; said the old soldier, &ldquo;because I have wronged
      you by a moment of unjust suspicion. For my daughter&rsquo;s sake, I bitterly
      regret that we did not see each other long ago; but I thank you,
      nevertheless, for coming here, even at the eleventh hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was speaking, one of his friends came up, and touching him on the
      shoulder, said: &ldquo;Berthelin, is that scoundrel to be allowed to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general turned on his heel directly, and beckoned contemptuously to
      Danville to follow him to the door. When they were well out of ear-shot,
      he spoke these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been exposed as a villain by your brother-in-law, and renounced
      as a liar by your mother. They have done their duty by you, and now it
      only remains for me to do mine. When a man enters the house of another
      under false pretenses, and compromises the reputation of his daughter, we
      old army men have a very expeditious way of making him answer for it. It
      is just three o&rsquo;clock now; at five you will find me and one of my friends&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and looked round cautiously&mdash;then whispered the rest in
      Danville&rsquo;s ear&mdash;threw open the door, and pointed downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our work here is done,&rdquo; said Lomaque, laying his hand on Trudaine&rsquo;s arm.
      &ldquo;Let us give Danville time to get clear of the house, and then leave it
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister! where is she?&rdquo; asked Trudaine, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your mind easy about her. I will tell you more when we get out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse me, I know,&rdquo; said General Berthelin, speaking to all the
      persons present, with his hand on the library door, &ldquo;if I leave you. I
      have bad news to break to my daughter, and private business after that to
      settle with a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saluted the company, with his usual bluff nod of the head, and entered
      the library. A few minutes afterward, Trudaine and Lomaque left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find your sister waiting for you in our apartment at the hotel,&rdquo;
       said the latter. &ldquo;She knows nothing, absolutely nothing, of what has
      passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the recognition?&rdquo; asked Trudaine, amazedly. &ldquo;His mother saw her.
      Surely she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I managed it so that she should be seen, and should not see. Our former
      experience of Danville suggested to me the propriety of making the
      experiment, and my old police-office practice came in useful in carrying
      it out. I saw the carriage standing at the door, and waited till the old
      lady came down. I walked your sister away as she got in, and walked her
      back again past the window as the carriage drove off. A moment did it, and
      it turned out as useful as I thought it would. Enough of that! Go back now
      to your sister. Keep indoors till the night mail starts for Rouen. I have
      had two places taken for you on speculation. Go! resume possession of your
      house, and leave me here to transact the business which my employer has
      intrusted to me, and to see how matters end with Danville and his mother.
      I will make time somehow to come and bid you good-by at Rouen, though it
      should be only for a single day. Bah! no thanks. Give us your hand. I was
      ashamed to take it eight years ago&mdash;I can give it a hearty shake now!
      There is your way; here is mine. Leave me to my business in silks and
      satins, and go you back to your sister, and help her to pack up for the
      night mail.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three more days have passed. It is evening. Rose, Trudaine and Lomaque are
      seated together on the bench that overlooks the windings of the Seine. The
      old familiar scene spreads before them, beautiful as ever&mdash;unchanged,
      as if it was but yesterday since they had all looked on it for the last
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talk together seriously and in low voices. The same recollections
      fill their hearts&mdash;recollections which they refrain from
      acknowledging, but the influence of which each knows by instinct that the
      other partakes. Sometimes one leads the conversation, sometimes another;
      but whoever speaks, the topic chosen is always, as if by common consent, a
      topic connected with the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening darkens in, and Rose is the first to rise from the bench. A
      secret look of intelligence passes between her and her brother, and then
      she speaks to Lomaque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you follow me into the house,&rdquo; she asks, &ldquo;with as little delay as
      possible? I have something that I very much wish to show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brother waits till she is out of hearing, then inquires anxiously what
      has happened at Paris since the night when he and Rose left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister is free,&rdquo; Lomaque answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The duel took place, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same day. They were both to fire together. The second of his
      adversary asserts that he was paralyzed with terror; his own second
      declares that he was resolved, however he might have lived, to confront
      death courageously by offering his life at the first fire to the man whom
      he had injured. Which account is true, I know not. It is only certain that
      he did not discharge his pistol, that he fell by his antagonist&rsquo;s first
      bullet, and that he never spoke afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard to gain information. Her doors are closed; the old servant
      guards her with jealous care. A medical man is in constant attendance, and
      there are reports in the house that the illness from which she is
      suffering affects her mind more than her body. I could ascertain no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that answer they both remain silent for a little while, then rise
      from the bench and walk toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you thought yet about preparing your sister to hear of all that has
      happened?&rdquo; Lomaque asks, as he sees the lamp-light glimmering in the
      parlor window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall wait to prepare her till we are settled again here&mdash;till the
      first holiday pleasure of our return has worn off, and the quiet realities
      of our every-day life of old have resumed their way,&rdquo; answers Trudaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      They enter the house. Rose beckons to Lomaque to sit down near her, and
      places pen and ink and an open letter before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a last favor to ask of you,&rdquo; she says, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it will not take long to grant,&rdquo; he rejoins; &ldquo;for I have only
      to-night to be with you. To-morrow morning, before you are up, I must be
      on my way back to Chalons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sign that letter?&rdquo; she continues, still smiling, &ldquo;and then give
      it to me to send to the post? It was dictated by Louis, and written by me,
      and it will be quite complete, if you will put your name at the end of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I may read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nods, and Lomaque reads these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CITIZEN&mdash;I beg respectfully to apprise you that the commission you
      intrusted to me at Paris has been performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have also to beg that you will accept my resignation of the place I
      hold in your counting-house. The kindness shown me by you and your brother
      before you, emboldens me to hope that you will learn with pleasure the
      motive of my withdrawal. Two friends of mine, who consider that they are
      under some obligations to me, are anxious that I should pass the rest of
      my days in the quiet and protection of their home. Troubles of former
      years have knit us together as closely as if we were all three members of
      one family. I need the repose of a happy fireside as much as any man,
      after the life I have led; and my friends assure me so earnestly that
      their whole hearts are set on establishing the old man&rsquo;s easy-chair by
      their hearth, that I cannot summon resolution enough to turn my back on
      them and their offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept, then, I beg of you, the resignation which this letter contains,
      and with it the assurance of my sincere gratitude and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Citizen Clairfait, Silk-mercer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chalons-sur-Marne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After reading these lines, Lomaque turned round to Trudaine and attempted
      to speak; but the words would not come at command. He looked up at Rose,
      and tried to smile; but his lip only trembled. She dipped the pen in the
      ink, and placed it in his hand. He bent his head down quickly over the
      paper, so that she could not see his face; but still he did not write his
      name. She put her hand caressingly on his shoulder, and whispered to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, humor &lsquo;Sister Rose.&rsquo; She must have her own way now she is
      back again at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer&mdash;his head sank lower&mdash;he hesitated for an
      instant&mdash;then signed his name in faint, trembling characters, at the
      end of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew it away from him gently. A few tear-drops lay on the paper. As
      she dried them with her handkerchief she looked at her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the last he shall ever shed, Louis; you and I will take care of
      that!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      EPILOGUE TO THE THIRD STORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have now related all that is eventful in the history of SISTER ROSE. To
      the last the three friends dwelt together happily in the cottage on the
      river bank. Mademoiselle Clairfait was fortunate enough to know them,
      before Death entered the little household and took away, in the fullness
      of time, the eldest of its members. She describes Lomaque, in her quaint
      foreign English, as &ldquo;a brave, big heart&rdquo;; generous, affectionate, and
      admirably free from the small obstinacies and prejudices of old age,
      except on one point: he could never be induced to take his coffee, of an
      evening, from any other hand than the hand of Sister Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I linger over these final particulars with a strange unwillingness to
      separate myself from them, and give my mind to other thoughts. Perhaps the
      persons and events that have occupied my attention for so many nights past
      have some peculiar interest for me that I cannot analyze. Perhaps the
      labor and time which this story has cost me have especially endeared it to
      my sympathies, now that I have succeeded in completing it. However that
      may be, I have need of some resolution to part at last with Sister Rose,
      and return, in the interests of my next and Fourth Story, to English
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experienced so much difficulty, let me add, in deciding on the
      choice of a new narrative out of my collection, that my wife has lost all
      patience, and has undertaken, on her own responsibility, to relieve me of
      my unreasonable perplexities. By her advice&mdash;given, as usual, without
      a moment&rsquo;s hesitation&mdash;I cannot do better than tell the story of
    </p>

    <h2>
      PROLOGUE TO THE FOURTH STORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My practice in the art of portrait-painting, if it has done nothing else,
      has at least fitted me to turn my talents (such as they are) to a great
      variety of uses. I have not only taken the likenesses of men, women, and
      children, but have also extended the range of my brush, under stress of
      circumstances, to horses, dogs, houses, and in one case even to a bull&mdash;the
      terror and glory of his parish, and the most truculent sitter I ever had.
      The beast was appropriately named &ldquo;Thunder and Lightning,&rdquo; and was the
      property of a gentleman-farmer named Garthwaite, a distant connection of
      my wife&rsquo;s family.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it was that I escaped being gored to death before I had finished my
      picture is more than I can explain to this day. &ldquo;Thunder and Lightning&rdquo;
       resented the very sight of me and my color-box, as if he viewed the taking
      of his likeness in the light of a personal insult. It required two men to
      coax him, while a third held him by a ring in his nostrils, before I could
      venture on beginning to work. Even then he always lashed his tail, and
      jerked his huge head, and rolled his fiery eyes with a devouring anxiety
      to have me on his horns for daring to sit down quietly and look at him.
      Never, I can honestly say, did I feel more heartily grateful for the
      blessings of soundness of limb and wholeness of skin, than when I had
      completed the picture of the bull!
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, when I had but little more than half done my unwelcome task,
      my friend and I were met on our way to the bull&rsquo;s stable by the farm
      bailiff, who informed us gravely that &ldquo;Thunder and Lightning&rdquo; was just
      then in such an especially surly state of temper as to render it quite
      unsafe for me to think of painting him. I looked inquiringly at Mr.
      Garthwaite, who smiled with an air of comic resignation, and said, &ldquo;Very
      well, then, we have nothing for it but to wait till to-morrow. What do you
      say to a morning&rsquo;s fishing, Mr. Kerby, now that my bull&rsquo;s bad temper has
      given us a holiday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied, with perfect truth, that I knew nothing about fishing. But Mr.
      Garthwaite, who was as ardent an angler in his way as Izaak Walton
      himself, was not to be appeased even by the best of excuses. &ldquo;It is never
      too late to learn,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;I will make a fisherman of you in no time,
      if you will only attend to my directions.&rdquo; It was impossible for me to
      make any more apologies, without the risk of appealing discourteous. So I
      thanked my host for his friendly intentions, and, with some secret
      misgivings, accepted the first fishing-rod that he put into my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon get there,&rdquo; said Mr. Garthwaite. &ldquo;I am taking you to the
      best mill-stream in the neighborhood.&rdquo; It was all one to me whether we got
      there soon or late and whether the stream was good or bad. However, I did
      my best to conceal my unsportsman-like apathy; and tried to look quite
      happy and very impatient to begin, as we drew near to the mill, and heard
      louder and louder the gushing of many waters all round it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leading the way immediately to a place beneath the falling stream, where
      there was a deep, eddying pool, Mr. Garthwaite baited and threw in his
      line before I had fixed the joints of my fishing-rod. This first
      difficulty overcome, I involuntarily plunged into some excellent, but
      rather embarrassing, sport with my line and hook. I caught every one of my
      garments, from head to foot; I angled for my own clothes with the
      dexterity and success of Izaak Walton himself. I caught my hat, my jacket,
      my waistcoat, my trousers, my fingers, and my thumbs&mdash;some devil
      possessed my hook; some more than eel-like vitality twirled and twisted in
      every inch of my line. By the time my host arrived to assist me, I had
      attached myself to my fishing-rod, apparently for life. All difficulties
      yielded, however, to his patience and skill; my hook was baited for me,
      and thrown in; my rod was put into my hand; my friend went back to his
      place; and we began at last to angle in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We certainly caught a few fish (in <i>my</i> case, I mean, of course, that
      the fish caught themselves); but they were scanty in number and light in
      weight. Whether it was the presence of the miller&rsquo;s foreman&mdash;a gloomy
      personage, who stood staring disastrously upon us from a little
      flower-garden on the opposite bank&mdash;that cast adverse influence over
      our sport; or whether my want of faith and earnestness as an angler acted
      retributively on my companion as well as myself, I know not; but it is
      certain that he got almost as little reward for his skill as I got for my
      patience. After nearly two hours of intense expectation on my part, and
      intense angling on his, Mr. Garthwaite jerked his line out of the water in
      a rage, and bade me follow him to another place, declaring that the stream
      must have been netted by poachers in the night, who had taken all the
      large fish away with them, and had thrown in the small ones to grow until
      their next visit. We moved away, further down the bank, leaving the
      imperturbable foreman still in the flower-garden, staring at us
      speechlessly on our departure, exactly as he had already stared at us on
      our approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; said Mr. Garthwaite suddenly, after we had walked some
      distance in silence by the side of the stream, &ldquo;I have an idea. Now we are
      out for a day&rsquo;s angling, we won&rsquo;t be balked. Instead of trying the water
      here again, we will go where I know, by experience, that the fishing is
      excellent. And what is more, you shall be introduced to a lady whose
      appearance is sure to interest you, and whose history, I can tell you
      beforehand, is a very remarkable one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;May I ask in what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is connected,&rdquo; answered Mr. Garthwaite, &ldquo;with an extraordinary story,
      which relates to a family once settled in an old house in this
      neighborhood. Her name is Miss Welwyn; but she is less formally known an
      among the poor people about here, who love her dearly, and honor her
      almost superstitiously, as the Lady of Glenwith Grange. Wait till you have
      seen her before you ask me to say anything more. She lives in the
      strictest retirement; I am almost the only visitor who is admitted. Don&rsquo;t
      say you had rather not go in. Any friend of mine will be welcome at the
      Grange (the scene of the story, remember), for my sake&mdash;the more
      especially because I have never abused my privilege of introduction. The
      place is not above two miles from here, and the stream (which we call, in
      our county dialect, Glenwith Beck) runs through the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we walked on, Mr. Garthwaite&rsquo;s manner altered. He became unusually
      silent and thoughtful. The mention of Miss Welwyn&rsquo;s name had evidently
      called up some recollections which were not in harmony with his every-day
      mood. Feeling that to talk to him on any indifferent subject would be only
      to interrupt his thoughts to no purpose, I walked by his side in perfect
      silence, looking out already with some curiosity and impatience for a
      first view of Glenwith Grange. We stopped at last close by an old church,
      standing on the outskirts of a pretty village. The low wall of the
      churchyard was bounded on one side by a plantation, and was joined by a
      park paling, in which I noticed a small wicket-gate. Mr. Garthwaite opened
      it, and led me along a shrubbery path, which conducted us circuitously to
      the dwelling-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had evidently entered by a private way, for we approached the building
      by the back. I looked up at it curiously, and saw standing at one of the
      windows on the lower floor a little girl watching us as we advanced. She
      seemed to be about nine or ten years old. I could not help stopping a
      moment to look up at her, her clear complexion and her long dark hair were
      so beautiful. And yet there was something in her expression&mdash;a
      dimness and vacancy in her large eyes&mdash;a changeless, unmeaning smile
      on her parted lips&mdash;which seemed to jar with all that was naturally
      attractive in her face; which perplexed, disappointed, and even shocked
      me, though I hardy knew why. Mr. Garthwaite, who had been walking along
      thoughtfully, with his eyes on the ground, turned back when he found me
      lingering behind him; looked up where I was looking; started a little, I
      thought; then took my arm, whispered rather impatiently, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say
      anything about having seen that poor child when you are introduced to Miss
      Welwyn; I&rsquo;ll tell you why afterward,&rdquo; and led me round hastily to the
      front of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very dreary old house, with a lawn in front thickly sprinkled
      with flower-beds, and creepers of all sorts climbing in profusion about
      the heavy stone porch and the mullions of the lower windows. In spite of
      these prettiest of all ornaments clustering brightly round the building&mdash;in
      spite of the perfect repair in which it was kept from top to bottom&mdash;there
      was something repellent to me in the aspect of the whole place: a deathly
      stillness hung over it, which fell oppressively on my spirits. When my
      companion rang the loud, deep-toned bell, the sound startled me as if we
      had been committing a crime in disturbing the silence. And when the door
      was opened by an old female servant (while the hollow echo of the bell was
      still vibrating in the air), I could hardly imagine it possible that we
      should be let in. We were admitted, however, without the slightest demur.
      I remarked that there was the same atmosphere of dreary repose inside the
      house which I had already observed, or rather felt, outside it. No dogs
      barked at our approach&mdash;no doors banged in the servants&rsquo; offices&mdash;no
      heads peeped over the banisters&mdash;not one of the ordinary domestic
      consequences of an unexpected visit in the country met either eye or ear.
      The large shadowy apartment, half library, half breakfast-room, into which
      we were ushered, was as solitary as the hall of entrance; unless I except
      such drowsy evidences of life as were here presented to us in the shape of
      an Angola cat and a gray parrot&mdash;the first lying asleep in a chair,
      the second sitting ancient, solemn, and voiceless, in a large cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Garthwaite walked to the window when we entered, without saying a
      word. Determining to let his taciturn humor have its way, I asked him no
      questions, but looked around the room to see what information it would
      give me (and rooms often do give such information) about the character and
      habits of the owner of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two tables covered with books were the first objects that attracted me. On
      approaching them, I was surprised to find that the all-influencing
      periodical literature of the present day&mdash;whose sphere is already
      almost without limit; whose readers, even in our time, may be numbered by
      millions&mdash;was entirely unrepresented on Miss Welwyn&rsquo;s table. Nothing
      modern, nothing contemporary, in the world of books, presented itself. Of
      all the volumes beneath my hand, not one bore the badge of the circulating
      library, or wore the flaring modern livery of gilt cloth. Every work that
      I took up had been written at least fifteen or twenty years since. The
      prints hanging round the walls (toward which I next looked) were all
      engraved from devotional subjects by the old masters; the music-stand
      contained no music of later date than the compositions of Haydn and
      Mozart. Whatever I examined besides, told me, with the same consistency,
      the same strange tale. The owner of these possessions lived in the by-gone
      time; lived among old recollections and old associations&mdash;a voluntary
      recluse from all that was connected with the passing day. In Miss Welwyn&rsquo;s
      house, the stir, the tumult, the &ldquo;idle business&rdquo; of the world evidently
      appealed in vain to sympathies which grew no longer with the growing hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these thoughts were passing through my mind, the door opened and the
      lady herself appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked certainly past the prime of life; longer past it, as I
      afterward discovered, than she really was. But I never remember, in any
      other face, to have seen so much of the better part of the beauty of early
      womanhood still remaining, as I saw in hers. Sorrow had evidently passed
      over the fair, calm countenance before me, but had left resignation there
      as its only trace. Her expression was still youthful&mdash;youthful in its
      kindness and its candor especially. It was only when I looked at her hair,
      that was now growing gray&mdash;at her wan, thin hands&mdash;at the faint
      lines marked round her mouth&mdash;at the sad serenity of her eyes, that I
      fairly detected the mark of age; and, more than that, the token of some
      great grief, which had been conquered, but not banished. Even from her
      voice alone&mdash;from the peculiar uncertainty of its low, calm tones
      when she spoke&mdash;it was easy to conjecture that she must have passed
      through sufferings, at some time of her life, which had tried to the quick
      the noble nature that they could not subdue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Garthwaite and she met each other almost like brother and sister; it
      was plain that the friendly intimacy between them had been of very long
      duration. Our visit was a short one. The conversation never advanced
      beyond the commonplace topics suited to the occasion. It was, therefore,
      from what I saw, and not from what I heard, that I was enabled to form my
      judgment of Miss Welwyn. Deeply as she had interested me&mdash;far more
      deeply than I at all know how to explain in fitting words&mdash;I cannot
      say that I was unwilling to depart when we rose to take leave. Though
      nothing could be more courteous and more kind than her manner toward me
      during the whole interview, I could still perceive that it cost her some
      effort to repress in my presence the shades of sadness and reserve which
      seemed often ready to steal over her. And I must confess that when I once
      or twice heard the half-sigh stifled, and saw the momentary relapse into
      thoughtfulness suddenly restrained, I felt an indefinable awkwardness in
      my position which made me ill at ease; which set me doubting whether, as a
      perfect stranger, I had done right in suffering myself to be introduced
      where no new faces could awaken either interest or curiosity; where no new
      sympathies could ever be felt, no new friendships ever be formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we had taken leave of Miss Welwyn, and were on our way to the
      stream in her grounds, I more than satisfied Mr. Garthwaite that the
      impression the lady had produced on me was of no transitory kind, by
      overwhelming him with questions about her&mdash;not omitting one or two
      incidental inquiries on the subject of the little girl whom I had seen at
      the back window. He only rejoined that his story would answer all my
      questions; and that he would begin to tell it as soon as we had arrived at
      Glenwith Beck, and were comfortably settled to fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes more of walking brought us to the bank of the stream, and
      showed us the water running smoothly and slowly, tinged with the softest
      green luster from the reflections of trees which almost entirely arched it
      over. Leaving me to admire the view at my ease, Mr. Garthwaite occupied
      himself with the necessary preparations for angling, baiting my hook as
      well as his own. Then, desiring me to sit near him on the bank, he at last
      satisfied my curiosity by beginning his story. I shall relate it in his
      own manner, and, as nearly as possible, in his own words.

    <h2>
      THE ANGLER&rsquo;S STORY of THE LADY OF GLENWITH GRANGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have known Miss Welwyn long enough to be able to bear personal testimony
      to the truth of many of the particulars which I am now about to relate. I
      knew her father, and her younger sister Rosamond; and I was acquainted
      with the Frenchman who became Rosamond&rsquo;s husband. These are the persons of
      whom it will be principally necessary for me to speak. They are the only
      prominent characters in my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Welwyn&rsquo;s father died some years since. I remember him very well&mdash;though
      he never excited in me, or in any one else that I ever heard of, the
      slightest feeling of interest. When I have said that he inherited a very
      large fortune, amassed during his father&rsquo;s time, by speculations of a very
      daring, very fortunate, but not always very honorable kind, and that he
      bought this old house with the notion of raising his social position, by
      making himself a member of our landed aristocracy in these parts, I have
      told you as much about him, I suspect, as you would care to hear. He was a
      thoroughly commonplace man, with no great virtues and no great vices in
      him. He had a little heart, a feeble mind, an amiable temper, a tall
      figure, and a handsome face. More than this need not, and cannot, be said
      on the subject of Mr. Welwyn&rsquo;s character.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must have seen the late Mrs. Welwyn very often as a child; but I cannot
      say that I remember anything more of her than that she was tall and
      handsome, and very generous and sweet-tempered toward me when I was in her
      company. She was her husband&rsquo;s superior in birth, as in everything else;
      was a great reader of books in all languages; and possessed such admirable
      talents as a musician, that her wonderful playing on the organ is
      remembered and talked of to this day among the old people in our country
      houses about here. All her friends, as I have heard, were disappointed
      when she married Mr. Welwyn, rich as he was; and were afterward astonished
      to find her preserving the appearance, at least, of being perfectly happy
      with a husband who, neither in mind nor heart, was worthy of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was generally supposed (and I have no doubt correctly) that she found
      her great happiness and her great consolation in her little girl Ida&mdash;now
      the lady from whom we have just parted. The child took after her mother
      from the first&mdash;inheriting her mother&rsquo;s fondness for books, her
      mother&rsquo;s love of music, her mother&rsquo;s quick sensibilities, and, more than
      all, her mother&rsquo;s quiet firmness, patience, and loving kindness of
      disposition. From Ida&rsquo;s earliest years, Mrs. Welwyn undertook the whole
      superintendence of her education. The two were hardly ever apart, within
      doors or without. Neighbors and friends said that the little girl was
      being brought up too fancifully, and was not enough among other children,
      was sadly neglected as to all reasonable and practical teaching, and was
      perilously encouraged in those dreamy and imaginative tendencies of which
      she had naturally more than her due share. There was, perhaps, some truth
      in this; and there might have been still more, if Ida had possessed an
      ordinary character, or had been reserved for an ordinary destiny. But she
      was a strange child from the first, and a strange future was in store for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Ida reached her eleventh year without either brother or sister to
      be her playfellow and companion at home. Immediately after that period,
      however, her sister Rosamond was born. Though Mr. Welwyn&rsquo;s own desire was
      to have had a son, there were, nevertheless, great rejoicings yonder in
      the old house on the birth of this second daughter. But they were all
      turned, only a few months afterward, to the bitterest grief and despair:
      the Grange lost its mistress. While Rosamond was still an infant in arms,
      her mother died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Welwyn had been afflicted with some disorder after the birth of her
      second child, the name of which I am not learned enough in medical science
      to be able to remember. I only know that she recovered from it, to all
      appearance, in an unexpectedly short time; that she suffered a fatal
      relapse, and that she died a lingering and a painful death. Mr. Welwyn
      (who, in after years, had a habit of vaingloriously describing his
      marriage as &ldquo;a love-match on both sides&rdquo;) was really fond of his wife in
      his own frivolous, feeble way, and suffered as acutely as such a man could
      suffer, during the latter days of her illness, and at the terrible time
      when the doctors, one and all, confessed that her life was a thing to be
      despaired of. He burst into irrepressible passions of tears, and was
      always obliged to leave the sick-room whenever Mrs. Welwyn spoke of her
      approaching end. The last solemn words of the dying woman, the tenderest
      messages that she could give, the dearest parting wishes that she could
      express, the most earnest commands that she could leave behind her, the
      gentlest reasons for consolation that she could suggest to the survivors
      among those who loved her, were not poured into her husband&rsquo;s ear, but
      into her child&rsquo;s. From the first period of her illness, Ida had persisted
      in remaining in the sick-room, rarely speaking, never showing outwardly
      any signs of terror or grief, except when she was removed from it; and
      then bursting into hysterical passions of weeping, which no
      expostulations, no arguments, no commands&mdash;nothing, in short, but
      bringing her back to the bedside&mdash;ever availed to calm. Her mother
      had been her playfellow, her companion her dearest and most familiar
      friend; and there seemed something in the remembrance of this which,
      instead of overwhelming the child with despair, strengthened her to watch
      faithfully and bravely by her dying parent to the very last.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the parting moment was over, and when Mr. Welwyn, unable to bear the
      shock of being present in the house of death at the time of his wife&rsquo;s
      funeral, left home and went to stay with one of his relations in a distant
      part of England, Ida, whom it had been his wish to take away with him,
      petitioned earnestly to be left behind. &ldquo;I promised mamma before she died
      that I would be as good to my little sister Rosamond as she had been to
      me,&rdquo; said the child, simply; &ldquo;and she told me in return that I might wait
      here and see her laid in her grave.&rdquo; There happened to be an aunt of Mrs.
      Welwyn, and an old servant of the family, in the house at this time, who
      understood Ida much better than her father did, and they persuaded him not
      to take her away. I have heard my mother say that the effect of the
      child&rsquo;s appearance at the funeral on her, and on all who went to see it,
      was something that she could never think of without the tears coming into
      her eyes, and could never forget to the last day of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been very shortly after this period that I saw Ida for the
      first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember accompanying my mother on a visit to the old house we have just
      left, in the summer, when I was at home for the holidays. It was a lovely,
      sunshiny morning. There was nobody indoors, and we walked out into the
      garden. As we approached that lawn yonder, on the other side of the
      shrubbery, I saw, first, a young woman in mourning (apparently a servant)
      sitting reading; then a little girl, dressed all in black, moving toward
      us slowly over the bright turf, and holding up before her a baby, whom she
      was trying to teach to walk. She looked, to my ideas, so very young to be
      engaged in such an occupation as this, and her gloomy black frock appeared
      to be such an unnaturally grave garment for a mere child of her age, and
      looked so doubly dismal by contrast with the brilliant sunny lawn on which
      she stood, that I quite started when I first saw her, and eagerly asked my
      mother who she was. The answer informed me of the sad family story, which
      I have been just relating to you. Mrs. Welwyn had then been buried about
      three months; and Ida, in her childish way, was trying, as she had
      promised, to supply her mother&rsquo;s place to her infant sister Rosamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      I only mention this simple incident, because it is necessary, before I
      proceed to the eventful part of my narrative, that you should know exactly
      in what relation the sisters stood toward one another from the first. Of
      all the last parting words that Mrs. Welwyn had spoken to her child, none
      had been oftener repeated, none more solemnly urged, than those which had
      commended the little Rosamond to Ida&rsquo;s love and care. To other persons,
      the full, the all-trusting dependence which the dying mother was known to
      have placed in a child hardly eleven years old, seemed merely a proof of
      that helpless desire to cling even to the feeblest consolations, which the
      approach of death so often brings with it. But the event showed that the
      trust so strangely placed had not been ventured vainly when it was
      committed to young and tender hands. The whole future existence of the
      child was one noble proof that she had been worthy of her mother&rsquo;s dying
      confidence, when it was first reposed in her. In that simple incident
      which I have just mentioned the new life of the two motherless sisters was
      all foreshadowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed. I left school&mdash;went to college&mdash;traveled in
      Germany, and stayed there some time to learn the language. At every
      interval when I came home, and asked about the Welwyns, the answer was, in
      substance, almost always the same. Mr. Welwyn was giving his regular
      dinners, performing his regular duties as a county magistrate, enjoying
      his regular recreations as an a amateur farmer and an eager sportsman. His
      two daughters were never separate. Ida was the same strange, quiet,
      retiring girl, that she had always been; and was still (as the phrase
      went) &ldquo;spoiling&rdquo; Rosamond in every way in which it was possible for an
      elder sister to spoil a younger by too much kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I myself went to the Grange occasionally, when I was in this neighborhood,
      in holiday and vacation time; and was able to test the correctness of the
      picture of life there which had been drawn for me. I remember the two
      sisters, when Rosamond was four or five years old; and when Ida seemed to
      me, even then, to be more like the child&rsquo;s mother than her sister. She
      bore with her little caprices as sisters do not bear with one another. She
      was so patient at lesson-time, so anxious to conceal any weariness that
      might overcome her in play hours, so proud when Rosamond&rsquo;s beauty was
      noticed, so grateful for Rosamond&rsquo;s kisses when the child thought of
      bestowing them, so quick to notice all that Rosamond did, and to attend to
      all that Rosamond said, even when visitors were in the room, that she
      seemed, to my boyish observation, altogether different from other elder
      sisters in other family circles into which I was then received.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember then, again, when Rosamond was just growing to womanhood, and
      was in high spirits at the prospect of spending a season in London, and
      being presented at court. She was very beautiful at that time&mdash;much
      handsomer than Ida. Her &ldquo;accomplishments&rdquo; were talked of far and near in
      our country circles. Few, if any, of the people, however, who applauded
      her playing and singing, who admired her water-color drawings, who were
      delighted at her fluency when she spoke French, and amazed at her ready
      comprehension when she read German, knew how little of all this elegant
      mental cultivation and nimble manual dexterity she owed to her governess
      and masters, and how much to her elder sister. It was Ida who really found
      out the means of stimulating her when she was idle; Ida who helped her
      through all her worst difficulties; Ida who gently conquered her defects
      of memory over her books, her inaccuracies of ear at the piano, her errors
      of taste when she took the brush and pencil in hand. It was Ida alone who
      worked these marvels, and whose all-sufficient reward for her hardest
      exertions was a chance word of kindness from her sister&rsquo;s lips. Rosamond
      was not unaffectionate, and not ungrateful; but she inherited much of her
      father&rsquo;s commonness and frivolity of character. She became so accustomed
      to owe everything to her sister&mdash;to resign all her most trifling
      difficulties to Ida&rsquo;s ever-ready care&mdash;to have all her tastes
      consulted by Ida&rsquo;s ever-watchful kindness&mdash;that she never
      appreciated, as it deserved, the deep, devoted love of which she was the
      object. When Ida refused two good offers of marriage, Rosamond was as much
      astonished as the veriest strangers, who wondered why the elder Miss
      Welwyn seemed bent on remaining single all her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the journey to London, to which I have already alluded, took place,
      Ida accompanied her father and sister. If she had consulted her own
      tastes, she would have remained in the country; but Rosamond declared that
      she should feel quite lost and helpless twenty times a day, in town,
      without her sister. It was in the nature of Ida to sacrifice herself to
      any one whom she loved, on the smallest occasions as well as the greatest.
      Her affection was as intuitively ready to sanctify Rosamond&rsquo;s slightest
      caprices as to excuse Rosamond&rsquo;s most thoughtless faults. So she went to
      London cheerfully, to witness with pride all the little triumphs won by
      her sister&rsquo;s beauty; to hear, and never tire of hearing, all that admiring
      friends could say in her sister&rsquo;s praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the season Mr. Welwyn and his daughters returned for a short
      time to the country; then left home again to spend the latter part of the
      autumn and the beginning of the winter in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took with them excellent letters of introduction, and saw a great
      deal of the best society in Paris, foreign as well as English. At one of
      the first of the evening parties which they attended, the general topic of
      conversation was the conduct of a certain French nobleman, the Baron
      Franval, who had returned to his native country after a long absence, and
      who was spoken of in terms of high eulogy by the majority of the guests
      present. The history of who Franval was, and of what he had done, was
      readily communicated to Mr. Welwyn and his daughters, and was briefly
      this:
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron inherited little from his ancestors besides his high rank and
      his ancient pedigree. On the death of his parents, he and his two
      unmarried sisters (their only surviving children) found the small
      territorial property of the Franvals, in Normandy, barely productive
      enough to afford a comfortable subsistence for the three. The baron, then
      a young man of three-and-twenty endeavored to obtain such military or
      civil employment as might become his rank; but, although the Bourbons were
      at that time restored to the throne of France, his efforts were
      ineffectual. Either his interest at court was bad, or secret enemies were
      at work to oppose his advancement. He failed to obtain even the slightest
      favor; and, irritated by undeserved neglect, resolved to leave France, and
      seek occupation for his energies in foreign countries, where his rank
      would be no bar to his bettering his fortunes, if he pleased, by engaging
      in commercial pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      An opportunity of the kind that he wanted unexpectedly offered itself. He
      left his sisters in care of an old male relative of the family at the
      chateau in Normandy, and sailed, in the first instance, to the West
      Indies; afterward extending his wanderings to the continent of South
      America, and there engaging in mining transactions on a very large scale.
      After fifteen years of absence (during the latter part of which time false
      reports of his death had reached Normandy), he had just returned to
      France, having realized a handsome independence, with which he proposed to
      widen the limits of his ancestral property, and to give his sisters (who
      were still, like himself, unmarried) all the luxuries and advantages that
      affluence could bestow. The baron&rsquo;s independent spirit and generous
      devotion to the honor of his family and the happiness of his surviving
      relatives were themes of general admiration in most of the social circles
      of Paris. He was expected to arrive in the capital every day; and it was
      naturally enough predicted that his reception in society there could not
      fail to be of the most flattering and most brilliant kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Welwyns listened to this story with some little interest; Rosamond,
      who was very romantic, being especially attracted by it, and openly
      avowing to her father and sister, when they got back to their hotel, that
      she felt as ardent a curiosity as anybody to see the adventurous and
      generous baron. The desire was soon gratified. Franval came to Paris, as
      had been anticipated&mdash;was introduced to the Welwyns&mdash;met them
      constantly in society&mdash;made no favorable impression on Ida, but won
      the good opinion of Rosamond from the first; and was regarded with such
      high approval by their father, that when he mentioned his intentions of
      visiting England in the spring of the new year, he was cordially invited
      to spend the hunting season at Glenwith Grange.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came back from Germany about the same time that the Welwyns returned
      from Paris, and at once set myself to improve my neighborly intimacy with
      the family. I was very fond of Ida; more fond, perhaps, than my vanity
      will now allow me to&mdash;; but that is of no consequence. It is much
      more to the purpose to tell you that I heard the whole of the baron&rsquo;s
      story enthusiastically related by Mr. Welwyn and Rosamond; that he came to
      the Grange at the appointed time; that I was introduced to him; and that
      he produced as unfavorable an impression upon me as he had already
      produced upon Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was whimsical enough; but I really could not tell why I disliked him,
      though I could account very easily, according to my own notions, for his
      winning the favor and approval of Rosamond and her father. He was
      certainly a handsome man as far as features went; he had a winning
      gentleness and graceful respect in his manner when he spoke to women; and
      he sang remarkably well, with one of the sweetest tenor voices I ever
      heard. These qualities alone were quite sufficient to attract any girl of
      Rosamond&rsquo;s disposition; and I certainly never wondered why he was a
      favorite of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as to her father, the baron was not only fitted to win his sympathy
      and regard in the field, by proving himself an ardent sportsman and an
      excellent rider; but was also, in virtue of some of his minor personal
      peculiarities, just the man to gain the friendship of his host. Mr. Welwyn
      was as ridiculously prejudiced as most weak-headed Englishmen are, on the
      subject of foreigners in general. In spite of his visit to Paris, the
      vulgar notion of a Frenchman continued to be <i>his</i> notion, both while
      he was in France and when he returned from it. Now, the baron was as
      unlike the traditional &ldquo;Mounseer&rdquo; of English songs, plays, and satires, as
      a man could well be; and it was on account of this very dissimilarity that
      Mr. Welwyn first took a violent fancy to him, and then invited him to his
      house. Franval spoke English remarkably well; wore neither beard,
      mustache, nor whiskers; kept his hair cut almost unbecomingly short;
      dressed in the extreme of plainness and modest good taste; talked little
      in general society; uttered his words, when he did speak, with singular
      calmness and deliberation; and, to crown all, had the greater part of his
      acquired property invested in English securities. In Mr. Welwyn&rsquo;s
      estimation, such a man as this was a perfect miracle of a Frenchman, and
      he admired and encouraged him accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that I disliked him, yet could not assign a reason for my
      dislike; and I can only repeat it now. He was remarkably polite to me; we
      often rode together in hunting, and sat near each other at the Grange
      table; but I could never become familiar with him. He always gave me the
      idea of a man who had some mental reservation in saying the most trifling
      thing. There was a constant restraint, hardly perceptible to most people,
      but plainly visible, nevertheless, to me, which seemed to accompany his
      lightest words, and to hang about his most familiar manner. This, however,
      was no just reason for my secretly disliking and distrusting him as I did.
      Ida said as much to me, I remember, when I confessed to her what my
      feelings toward him were, and tried (but vainly) to induce her to be
      equally candid with me in return. She seemed to shrink from the tacit
      condemnation of Rosamond&rsquo;s opinion which such a confidence on her part
      would have implied. And yet she watched the growth of that opinion&mdash;or,
      in other words, the growth of her sister&rsquo;s liking for the baron&mdash;with
      an apprehension and sorrow which she tried fruitlessly to conceal. Even
      her father began to notice that her spirits were not so good as usual, and
      to suspect the cause of her melancholy. I remember he jested, with all the
      dense insensibility of a stupid man, about Ida having invariably been
      jealous, from a child, if Rosamond looked kindly upon anybody except her
      elder sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring began to get far advanced toward summer. Franval paid a visit
      to London; came back in the middle of the season to Glenwith Grange; wrote
      to put off his departure for France; and at last (not at all to the
      surprise of anybody who was intimate with the Welwyns) proposed to
      Rosamond, and was accepted. He was candor and generosity itself when the
      preliminaries of the marriage-settlement were under discussion. He quite
      overpowered Mr. Welwyn and the lawyers with references, papers, and
      statements of the distribution and extent of his property, which were
      found to be perfectly correct. His sisters were written to, and returned
      the most cordial answers; saying that the state of their health would not
      allow them to come to England for the marriage; but adding a warm
      invitation to Normandy for the bride and her family. Nothing, in short,
      could be more straightforward and satisfactory than the baron&rsquo;s behavior,
      and the testimonies to his worth and integrity which the news of the
      approaching marriage produced from his relatives and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only joyless face at the Grange now was Ida&rsquo;s. At any time it would
      have been a hard trial to her to resign that first and foremost place
      which she had held since childhood in her sister&rsquo;s heart, as she knew she
      must resign it when Rosamond married. But, secretly disliking and
      distrusting Franval as she did, the thought that he was soon to become the
      husband of her beloved sister filled her with a vague sense of terror
      which she could not explain to herself; which it was imperatively
      necessary that she should conceal; and which, on those very accounts,
      became a daily and hourly torment to her that was almost more than she
      could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      One consolation alone supported her: Rosamond and she were not to be
      separated. She knew that the baron secretly disliked her as much as she
      disliked him; she knew that she must bid farewell to the brighter and
      happier part of her life on the day when she went to live under the same
      roof with her sister&rsquo;s husband; but, true to the promise made years and
      years ago by her dying mother&rsquo;s bed&mdash;true to the affection which was
      the ruling and beautiful feeling of her whole existence&mdash;she never
      hesitated about indulging Rosamond&rsquo;s wish, when the girl, in her bright,
      light-hearted way, said that she could never get on comfortably in the
      marriage state unless she had Ida to live with her and help her just the
      same as ever. The baron was too polite a man even to <i>look</i>
      dissatisfied when he heard of the proposed arrangement; and it was
      therefore settled from the beginning that Ida was always to live with her
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage took place in the summer, and the bride and bridegroom went
      to spend their honeymoon in Cumberland. On their return to Glenwith
      Grange, a visit to the baron&rsquo;s sisters, in Normandy, was talked of; but
      the execution of this project was suddenly and disastrously suspended by
      the death of Mr. Welwyn, from an attack of pleurisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of this calamity, the projected journey was of course
      deferred; and when autumn and the shooting season came, the baron was
      unwilling to leave the well-stocked preserves of the Grange. He seemed,
      indeed, to grow less and less inclined, as time advanced, for the trip to
      Normandy; and wrote excuse after excuse to his sisters, when letters
      arrived from them urging him to pay the promised visit. In the
      winter-time, he said he would not allow his wife to risk a long journey.
      In the spring, his health was pronounced to be delicate. In the genial
      summer-time, the accomplishment of the proposed visit would be impossible,
      for at that period the baroness expected to become a mother. Such were the
      apologies which Franval seemed almost glad to be able to send to his
      sisters in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage was, in the strictest sense of the term, a happy one. The
      baron, though he never altogether lost the strange restraint and reserve
      of his manner, was, in his quiet, peculiar way, the fondest and kindest of
      husbands. He went to town occasionally on business, but always seemed glad
      to return to the baroness; he never varied in the politeness of his
      bearing toward his wife&rsquo;s sister; he behaved with the most courteous
      hospitality toward all the friends of the Welwyns; in short, he thoroughly
      justified the good opinion which Rosamond and her father had formed of him
      when they first met at Paris. And yet no experience of his character
      thoroughly re-assured Ida. Months passed on quietly and pleasantly; and
      still that secret sadness, that indefinable, unreasonable apprehension on
      Rosamond&rsquo;s account, hung heavily on her sister&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the first summer months, a little domestic
      inconvenience happened, which showed the baroness, for the first time,
      that her husband&rsquo;s temper could be seriously ruffled&mdash;and that by the
      veriest trifle. He was in the habit of taking in two French provincial
      newspapers&mdash;one published at Bordeaux and the other at Havre. He
      always opened these journals the moment they came, looked at one
      particular column of each with the deepest attention, for a few minutes,
      then carelessly threw them aside into his waste-paper basket. His wife and
      her sister were at first rather surprised at the manner in which he read
      his two papers; but they thought no more of it when he explained that he
      only took them in to consult them about French commercial intelligence,
      which might be, occasionally, of importance to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These papers were published weekly. On the occasion to which I have just
      referred, the Bordeaux paper came on the proper day, as usual; but the
      Havre paper never made its appearance. This trifling circumstance seemed
      to make the baron seriously uneasy. He wrote off directly to the country
      post-office and to the newspaper agent in London. His wife, astonished to
      see his tranquillity so completely overthrown by so slight a cause, tried
      to restore his good humor by jesting with him about the missing newspaper.
      He replied by the first angry and unfeeling words that she had heard issue
      from his lips. She was then within about six weeks of her confinement, and
      very unfit to bear harsh answers from anybody&mdash;least of all from her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day no answer came. On the afternoon of the third, the baron
      rode off to the post town to make inquiries. About an hour after he had
      gone, a strange gentleman came to the Grange and asked to see the
      baroness. On being informed that she was not well enough to receive
      visitors, he sent up a message that his business was of great importance
      and that he would wait downstairs for a second answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      On receiving this message, Rosamond turned, as usual, to her elder sister
      for advice. Ida went downstairs immediately to see the stranger. What I am
      now about to tell you of the extraordinary interview which took place
      between them, and of the shocking events that followed it, I have heard
      from Miss Welwyn&rsquo;s own lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt unaccountably nervous when she entered the room. The stranger
      bowed very politely, and asked, in a foreign accent, if she were the
      Baroness Franval. She set him right on this point, and told him she
      attended to all matters of business for the baroness; adding that, if his
      errand at all concerned her sister&rsquo;s husband, the baron was not then at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger answered that he was aware of it when he called, and that the
      unpleasant business on which he came could not be confided to the baron&mdash;at
      least, in the first instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked why. He said he was there to explain; and expressed himself as
      feeling greatly relieved at having to open his business to her, because
      she would, doubtless, be best able to prepare her sister for the bad news
      that he was, unfortunately, obliged to bring. The sudden faintness which
      overcame her, as he spoke those words, prevented her from addressing him
      in return. He poured out some water for her from a bottle which happened
      to be standing on the table, and asked if he might depend on her
      fortitude. She tried to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; but the violent throbbing of her heart
      seemed to choke her. He took a foreign newspaper from his pocket, saying
      that he was a secret agent of the French police&mdash;that the paper was
      the Havre <i>Journal</i>, for the past week, and that it had been
      expressly kept from reaching the baron, as usual, through his (the
      agent&rsquo;s) interference. He then opened the newspaper, and begged that she
      would nerve herself sufficiently (for her sister&rsquo;s sake) to read certain
      lines, which would give her some hint of the business that brought him
      there. He pointed to the passage as he spoke. It was among the &ldquo;Shipping
      Entries,&rdquo; and was thus expressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrived, the <i>Berenice</i>, from San Francisco, with a valuable cargo
      of hides. She brings one passenger, the Baron Franval, of Chateau Franval,
      in Normandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Miss Welwyn read the entry, her heart, which had been throbbing
      violently but the moment before, seemed suddenly to cease from all action,
      and she began to shiver, though it was a warm June evening. The agent held
      the tumbler to her lips, and made her drink a little of the water,
      entreating her very earnestly to take courage and listen to him. He then
      sat down, and referred again to the entry, every word he uttered seeming
      to burn itself in forever (as she expressed it) on her memory and her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;It has been ascertained beyond the possibility of doubt that
      there is no mistake about the name in the lines you have just read. And it
      is as certain as that we are here, that there is only <i>one</i> Baron
      Franval now alive. The question, therefore, is, whether the passenger by
      the <i>Berenice</i> is the true baron, or&mdash;I beg you most earnestly
      to bear with me and to compose yourself&mdash;or the husband of your
      sister. The person who arrived last week at Havre was scouted as an
      impostor by the ladies at the chateau, the moment he presented himself
      there as the brother, returning to them after sixteen years of absence.
      The authorities were communicated with, and I and my assistants were
      instantly sent for from Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wasted no time in questioning the supposed impostor. He either was, or
      affected to be, in a perfect frenzy of grief and indignation. We just
      ascertained, from competent witnesses, that he bore an extraordinary
      resemblance to the real baron, and that he was perfectly familiar with
      places and persons in and about the chateau; we just ascertained that, and
      then proceeded to confer with the local authorities, and to examine their
      private entries of suspected persons in their jurisdiction, ranging back
      over a past period of twenty years or more. One of the entries thus
      consulted contained these particulars: &lsquo;Hector Auguste Monbrun, son of a
      respectable proprietor in Normandy. Well educated; gentleman-like manners.
      On bad terms with his family. Character: bold, cunning, unscrupulous,
      self-possessed. Is a clever mimic. May be easily recognized by his
      striking likeness to the Baron Franval. Imprisoned at twenty for theft and
      assault.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Welwyn saw the agent look up at her after he had read this extract
      from the police-book, to ascertain if she was still able to listen to him.
      He asked, with some appearance of alarm, as their eyes met, if she would
      like some more water. She was just able to make a sign in the negative. He
      took a second extract from his pocket-book, and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;The next entry under the same name was dated four years later,
      and ran thus, &lsquo;H. A. Monbrun, condemned to the galleys for life, for
      assassination, and other crimes not officially necessary to be here
      specified. Escaped from custody at Toulon. Is known, since the expiration
      of his first term of imprisonment, to have allowed his beard to grow, and
      to have worn his hair long, with the intention of rendering it impossible
      for those acquainted with him in his native province to recognize him, as
      heretofore, by his likeness to the Baron Franval.&rsquo; There were more
      particulars added, not important enough for extract. We immediately
      examined the supposed impostor; for, if he was Monbrun, we knew that we
      should find on his shoulder the two letters of the convict brand, &lsquo;T. F.,&rsquo;
      standing for <i>Travaux Forces</i>. After the minutest examination with
      the mechanical and chemical tests used on such occasions, not the
      slightest trace of the brand was to be found. The moment this astounding
      discovery was made, I started to lay an embargo on the forthcoming numbers
      of the Havre <i>Journal</i> for that week, which were about to be sent to
      the English agent in London. I arrived at Havre on Saturday (the morning
      of publication), in time to execute my design. I waited there long enough
      to communicate by telegraph with my superiors in Paris, then hastened to
      this place. What my errand here is, you may&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He might have gone on speaking for some moments longer; but Miss Welwyn
      heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first sensation of returning consciousness was the feeling that water
      was being sprinkled on her face. Then she saw that all the windows in the
      room had been set wide open, to give her air; and that she and the agent
      were still alone. At first she felt bewildered, and hardly knew who he
      was; but he soon recalled to her mind the horrible realities that had
      brought him there, by apologizing for not having summoned assistance when
      she fainted. He said it was of the last importance, in Franval&rsquo;s absence,
      that no one in the house should imagine that anything unusual was taking
      place in it. Then, after giving her an interval of a minute or two to
      collect what little strength she had left, he added that he would not
      increase her sufferings by saying anything more, just then, on the
      shocking subject of the investigation which it was his duty to make&mdash;that
      he would leave her to recover herself, and to consider what was the best
      course to be taken with the baroness in the present terrible emergency&mdash;and
      that he would privately return to the house between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock
      that evening, ready to act as Miss Welwyn wished, and to afford her and
      her sister any aid and protection of which they might stand in need. With
      these words he bowed, and noiselessly quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first few awful minutes after she was left alone, Miss Welwyn sat
      helpless and speechless; utterly numbed in heart, and mind, and body&mdash;then
      a sort of instinct (she was incapable of thinking) seemed to urge her to
      conceal the fearful news from her sister as long as possible. She ran
      upstairs to Rosamond&rsquo;s sitting-room, and called through the door (for she
      dared not trust herself in her sister&rsquo;s presence) that the visitor had
      come on some troublesome business from their late father&rsquo;s lawyers, and
      that she was going to shut herself up, and write some long letters in
      connection with that business. After she had got into her own room, she
      was never sensible of how time was passing&mdash;never conscious of any
      feeling within her, except a baseless, helpless hope that the French
      police might yet be proved to have made some terrible mistake&mdash;until
      she heard a violent shower of rain come on a little after sunset. The
      noise of the rain, and the freshness it brought with it in the air, seemed
      to awaken her as if from a painful and a fearful sleep. The power of
      reflection returned to her; her heart heaved and bounded with an
      overwhelming terror, as the thought of Rosamond came back vividly to it;
      her memory recurred despairingly to the long-past day of her mother&rsquo;s
      death, and to the farewell promise she had made by her mother&rsquo;s bedside.
      She burst into an hysterical passion of weeping that seemed to be tearing
      her to pieces. In the midst of it she heard the clatter of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs
      in the courtyard, and knew that Rosamond&rsquo;s husband had come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dipping her handkerchief in cold water, and passing it over her eyes as
      she left the room, she instantly hastened to her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately the daylight was fading in the old-fashioned chamber that
      Rosamond occupied. Before they could say two words to each other, Franval
      was in the room. He seemed violently irritated; said that he had waited
      for the arrival of the mail&mdash;that the missing newspaper had not come
      by it&mdash;that he had got wet through&mdash;that he felt a shivering fit
      coming on&mdash;and that he believed he had caught a violent cold. His
      wife anxiously suggested some simple remedies. He roughly interrupted her,
      saying there was but one remedy, the remedy of going to bed; and so left
      them without another word. She just put her handkerchief to her eyes, and
      said softly to her sister, &ldquo;How he is changed!&rdquo; then spoke no more. They
      sat silent for half an hour or longer. After that, Rosamond went
      affectionately and forgivingly to see how her husband was. She returned,
      saying that he was in bed, and in a deep, heavy sleep; and predicting
      hopefully that he would wake up quite well the next morning. In a few
      minutes more the clock stuck nine; and Ida heard the servant&rsquo;s step
      ascending the stairs. She suspected what his errand was, and went out to
      meet him. Her presentiment had not deceived her; the police agent had
      arrived, and was waiting for her downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked her if she had said anything to her sister, or had thought of any
      plan of action, the moment she entered the room; and, on receiving a reply
      in the negative, inquired, further, if &ldquo;the baron&rdquo; had come home yet. She
      answered that he had; that he was ill and tired, and vexed, and that he
      had gone to bed. The agent asked in an eager whisper if she knew that he
      was asleep, and alone in bed? and, when he received her reply, said that
      he must go up into the bedroom directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to feel the faintness coming over her again, and with it
      sensations of loathing and terror that she could neither express to others
      nor define to herself. He said that if she hesitated to let him avail
      himself of this unexpected opportunity, her scruples might lead to fatal
      results. He reminded her that if &ldquo;the baron&rdquo; were really the convict
      Monbrun, the claims of society and of justice demanded that he should be
      discovered by the first available means; and that if he were not&mdash;if
      some inconceivable mistake had really been committed&mdash;then such a
      plan for getting immediately at the truth as was now proposed would insure
      the delivery of an innocent man from suspicion; and at the same time spare
      him the knowledge that he had ever been suspected. This last argument had
      its effect on Miss Welwyn. The baseless, helpless hope that the French
      authorities might yet be proved to be in error, which she had already felt
      in her own room, returned to her now. She suffered the agent to lead her
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the candle from her hand when she pointed to the door; opened it
      softly; and, leaving it ajar, went into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked through the gap with a feverish, horror-struck curiosity.
      Franval was lying on his side in a profound sleep, with his back turned
      toward the door. The agent softly placed the candle upon a small
      reading-table between the door and the bedside, softly drew down the
      bed-clothes a little away from the sleeper&rsquo;s back, then took a pair of
      scissors from the toilet-table, and very gently and slowly began to cut
      away, first the loose folds, then the intervening strips of linen, from
      the part of Franval&rsquo;s night-gown that was over his shoulders. When the
      upper part of his back had been bared in this way, the agent took the
      candle and held it near the flesh. Miss Welwyn heard him ejaculate some
      word under his breath, then saw him looking round to where she was
      standing, and beckoning to her to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically she obeyed; mechanically she looked down where his finger was
      pointing. It was the convict Monbrun&mdash;there, just visible under the
      bright light of the candle, were the fatal letters &ldquo;T. F.&rdquo; branded on the
      villain&rsquo;s shoulder!
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she could neither move nor speak, the horror of this discovery did
      not deprive her of her consciousness. She saw the agent softly draw up the
      bed-clothes again into their proper position, replace the scissors on the
      toilet-table, and take from it a bottle of smelling-salts. She felt him
      removing her from the bedroom, and helping her quickly downstairs, giving
      her the salts to smell to by the way. When they were alone again, he said,
      with the first appearance of agitation that he had yet exhibited, &ldquo;Now,
      madam, for God&rsquo;s sake, collect all your courage, and be guided by me. You
      and your sister had better leave the house immediately. Have you any
      relatives in the neighborhood with whom you could take refuge?&rdquo; They had
      none. &ldquo;What is the name of the nearest town where you could get good
      accommodation for the night?&rdquo; Harleybrook (he wrote the name down on his
      tablets). &ldquo;How far off is it?&rdquo; Twelve miles. &ldquo;You had better have the
      carriage out at once, to go there with as little delay as possible,
      leaving me to pass the night here. I will communicate with you to-morrow
      at the principal hotel. Can you compose yourself sufficiently to be able
      to tell the head servant, if I ring for him, that he is to obey my orders
      till further notice?&rdquo; The servant was summoned, and received his
      instructions, the agent going out with him to see that the carriage was
      got ready quietly and quickly. Miss Welwyn went upstairs to her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the fearful news was first broken to Rosamond, I cannot relate to you.
      Miss Welwyn has never confided to me, has never confided to anybody, what
      happened at the interview between her sister and herself that night. I can
      tell you nothing of the shock they both suffered, except that the younger
      and the weaker died under it; that the elder and the stronger has never
      recovered from it, and never will.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went away the same night, with one attendant, to Harleybrook, as the
      agent had advised. Before daybreak Rosamond was seized with the pains of
      premature labor. She died three days after, unconscious of the horror of
      her situation, wandering in her mind about past times, and singing old
      tunes that Ida had taught her as she lay in her sister&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was born alive, and lives still. You saw her at the window as we
      came in at the back way to the Grange. I surprised you, I dare say, by
      asking you not to speak of her to Miss Welwyn. Perhaps you noticed
      something vacant in the little girl&rsquo;s expression. I am sorry to say that
      her mind is more vacant still. If &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; did not sound like a mocking
      word, however tenderly and pityingly one may wish to utter it, I should
      tell you that the poor thing had been an idiot from her birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will, doubtless, want to hear now what happened at Glenwith Grange
      after Miss Welwyn and her sister had left it. I have seen the letter which
      the police agent sent the next morning to Harleybrook; and, speaking from
      my recollection of that, I shall be able to relate all you can desire to
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, as to the past history of the scoundrel Monbrun, I need only tell
      you that he was identical with an escaped convict, who, for a long term of
      years, had successfully eluded the vigilance of the authorities all over
      Europe, and in America as well. In conjunction with two accomplices, he
      had succeeded in possessing himself of large sums of money by the most
      criminal means. He also acted secretly as the &ldquo;banker&rdquo; of his convict
      brethren, whose dishonest gains were all confided to his hands for
      safe-keeping. He would have been certainly captured, on venturing back to
      France, along with his two associates, but for the daring imposture in
      which he took refuge; and which, if the true Baron Franval had really died
      abroad, as was reported, would, in all probability, never have been found
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides his extraordinary likeness to the baron, he had every other
      requisite for carrying on his deception successfully. Though his parents
      were not wealthy, he had received a good education. He was so notorious
      for his gentleman-like manners among the villainous associates of his
      crimes and excesses, that they nicknamed him &ldquo;the Prince.&rdquo; All his early
      life had been passed in the neighborhood of the Chateau Franval. He knew
      what were the circumstances which had induced the baron to leave it. He
      had been in the country to which the baron had emigrated. He was able to
      refer familiarly to persons and localities, at home and abroad, with which
      the baron was sure to be acquainted. And, lastly, he had an expatriation
      of fifteen years to plead for him as his all-sufficient excuse, if he made
      any slight mistakes before the baron&rsquo;s sisters, in his assumed character
      of their long-absent brother. It will be, of course, hardly necessary for
      me to tell you, in relation to this part of the subject, that the true
      Franval was immediately and honorably reinstated in the family rights of
      which the impostor had succeeded for a time in depriving him.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Monbrun&rsquo;s own account, he had married poor Rosamond purely
      for love; and the probabilities certainly are, that the pretty, innocent
      English girl had really struck the villain&rsquo;s fancy for the time; and that
      the easy, quiet life he was leading at the Grange pleased him, by contrast
      with his perilous and vagabond existence of former days. What might have
      happened if he had had time enough to grow wearied of his ill-fated wife
      and his English home, it is now useless to inquire. What really did happen
      on the morning when he awoke after the flight of Ida and her sister can be
      briefly told.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as his eyes opened they rested on the police agent, sitting
      quietly by the bedside, with a loaded pistol in his hand. Monbrun knew
      immediately that he was discovered; but he never for an instant lost the
      self-possession for which he was famous. He said he wished to have five
      minutes allowed him to deliberate quietly in bed, whether he should resist
      the French authorities on English ground, and so gain time by obliging the
      one Government to apply specially to have him delivered up by the other&mdash;or
      whether he should accept the terms officially offered to him by the agent,
      if he quietly allowed himself to be captured. He chose the latter course&mdash;it
      was suspected, because he wished to communicate personally with some of
      his convict associates in France, whose fraudulent gains were in his
      keeping, and because he felt boastfully confident of being able to escape
      again, whenever he pleased. Be his secret motives, however, what they
      might, he allowed the agent to conduct him peaceably from the Grange;
      first writing a farewell letter to poor Rosamond, full of heartless French
      sentiment and glib sophistries about Fate and Society. His own fate was
      not long in overtaking him. He attempted to escape again, as it had been
      expected he would, and was shot by the sentinel on duty at the time. I
      remember hearing that the bullet entered his head and killed him on the
      spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      My story is done. It is ten years now since Rosamond was buried in the
      churchyard yonder; and it is ten years also since Miss Welwyn returned to
      be the lonely inhabitant of Glenwith Grange. She now lives but in the
      remembrances that it calls up before her of her happier existence of
      former days. There is hardly an object in the old house which does not
      tenderly and solemnly remind her of the mother, whose last wishes she
      lived to obey; of the sister, whose happiness was once her dearest earthly
      care. Those prints that you noticed on the library walls Rosamond used to
      copy in the past time, when her pencil was often guided by Ida&rsquo;s hand.
      Those music-books that you were looking over, she and her mother have
      played from together through many a long and quiet summer&rsquo;s evening. She
      has no ties now to bind her to the present but the poor child whose
      affliction it is her constant effort to lighten, and the little peasant
      population around her, whose humble cares and wants and sorrows she is
      always ready to relieve. Far and near her modest charities have penetrated
      among us; and far and near she is heartily beloved and blessed in many a
      laborer&rsquo;s household. There is no poor man&rsquo;s hearth, not in this village
      only, but for miles away from it as well, at which you would not be
      received with the welcome given to an old friend, if you only told the
      cottagers that you knew the Lady of Glenwith Grange!

    <h2>
      PROLOGUE TO THE FIFTH STORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next piece of work which occupied my attention after taking leave of
      Mr. Garthwaite, offered the strongest possible contrast to the task which
      had last engaged me. Fresh from painting a bull at a farmhouse, I set
      forth to copy a Holy Family, by Correggio, at a convent of nuns. People
      who go to the Royal Academy Exhibition, and see pictures by famous
      artists, painted year after year in the same marked style which first made
      them celebrated, would be amazed indeed if they knew what a
      Jack-of-all-trades a poor painter must become before he can gain his daily
      bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture by Correggio which I was now commissioned to copy had been
      lent to the nuns by a Catholic gentleman of fortune, who prized it as the
      gem of his collection, and who had never before trusted it out of his own
      hands. My copy, when completed, was to be placed over the high altar of
      the convent chapel; and my work throughout its progress was to be pursued
      entirely in the parlor of the nunnery, and always in the watchful presence
      of one or other of the inmates of the house. It was only on such
      conditions that the owner of the Correggio was willing to trust his
      treasure out of his own hands, and to suffer it to be copied by a
      stranger. The restrictions he imposed, which I thought sufficiently
      absurd, and perhaps offensively suspicious as well, were communicated to
      me politely enough before I was allowed to undertake the commission.
      Unless I was inclined to submit to precautionary regulations which would
      affect any other artist exactly as they affected me, I was told not to
      think of offering to make the copy; and the nuns would then address
      themselves to some other person in my profession. After a day&rsquo;s
      consideration, I submitted to the restrictions, by my wife&rsquo;s advice, and
      saved the nuns the trouble of making application for a copier of Correggio
      in any other quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the convent was charmingly situated in a quiet little valley in
      the West of England. The parlor in which I was to paint was a large,
      well-lighted apartment; and the village inn, about half a mile off,
      afforded me cheap and excellent quarters for the night. Thus far,
      therefore, there was nothing to complain of. As for the picture, which was
      the next object of interest to me, I was surprised to find that the
      copying of it would be by no means so difficult a task as I had
      anticipated. I am rather of a revolutionary spirit in matters of art, and
      am bold enough to think that the old masters have their faults as well as
      their beauties. I can give my opinion, therefore, on the Correggio at the
      convent independently at least. Looked at technically, the picture was a
      fine specimen of coloring and execution; but looked at for the higher
      merits of delicacy, elevation, and feeling for the subject, it deserved
      copying as little as the most commonplace work that any unlucky modern
      artist ever produced. The faces of the Holy Family not only failed to
      display the right purity and tenderness of expression, but absolutely
      failed to present any expression at all. It is flat heresy to say so, but
      the valuable Correggio was nevertheless emphatically, and, in so many
      words, a very uninteresting picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the convent and the work that I was to do in it. My next
      anxiety was to see how the restrictions imposed on me were to be carried
      out. The first day, the Mother Superior herself mounted guard in the
      parlor&mdash;a stern, silent, fanatical-looking woman, who seemed
      determined to awe me and make me uncomfortable, and who succeeded
      thoroughly in the execution of her purpose. The second day she was
      relieved by the officiating priest of the convent&mdash;a mild,
      melancholy, gentleman-like man, with whom I got on tolerably well. The
      third day, I had for overlooker the portress of the house&mdash;a dirty,
      dismal, deaf, old woman, who did nothing but knit stockings and chew
      orris-root. The fourth day, a middle-aged nun, whom I heard addressed as
      Mother Martha, occupied the post of guardian to the precious Correggio;
      and with her the number of my overlookers terminated. She, and the
      portress, and the priest, and the Mother Superior, relieved each other
      with military regularity, until I had put the last touch to my copy. I
      found them ready for me every morning on entering the parlor, and I left
      them in the chair of observation every evening on quitting it. As for any
      young and beautiful nuns who might have been in the building, I never so
      much as set eyes on the ends of their veils. From the door to the parlor,
      and from the parlor to the door, comprised the whole of my experience of
      the inside of the convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only one of my superintending companions with whom I established
      anything like a familiar acquaintance was Mother Martha. She had no
      outward attractions to recommend her; but she was simple, good-humored,
      ready to gossip, and inquisitive to a perfectly incredible degree. Her
      whole life had been passed in the nunnery; she was thoroughly accustomed
      to her seclusion, thoroughly content with the monotonous round of her
      occupations; not at all anxious to see the world for herself; but, on the
      other hand, insatiably curious to know all about it from others. There was
      no question connected with myself, my wife, my children, my friends, my
      profession, my income, my travels, my favorite amusements, and even my
      favorite sins, which a woman could ask a man, that Mother Martha did not,
      in the smallest and softest of voices, ask of me. Though an intelligent,
      well-informed person in all that related to her own special vocation, she
      was a perfect child in everything else. I constantly caught myself talking
      to her, just as I should have talked at home to one of my own little
      girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope no one will think that, in expressing myself thus, I am writing
      disparagingly of the poor nun. On two accounts, I shall always feel
      compassionately and gratefully toward Mother Martha. She was the only
      person in the convent who seemed sincerely anxious to make her presence in
      the parlor as agreeable to me as possible; and she good-humoredly told me
      the story which it is my object in these pages to introduce to the reader.
      In both ways I am deeply indebted to her; and I hope always to remember
      the obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances under which the story came to be related to me may be
      told in very few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of a convent parlor being a complete novelty to me, I looked
      around with some interest on first entering my painting-room at the
      nunnery. There was but little in it to excite the curiosity of any one.
      The floor was covered with common matting, and the ceiling with plain
      whitewash. The furniture was of the simplest kind; a low chair with a
      praying-desk fixed to the back, and a finely carved oak book-case, studded
      all over with brass crosses, being the only useful objects that I could
      discern which had any conventional character about them. As for the
      ornaments of the room, they were entirely beyond my appreciation. I could
      feel no interest in the colored prints of saints, with gold platters at
      the backs of their heads, that hung on the wall; and I could see nothing
      particularly impressive in the two plain little alabaster pots for holy
      water, fastened, one near the door, the other over the chimney-piece. The
      only object, indeed, in the whole room which in the slightest degree
      attracted my curiosity was an old worm-eaten wooden cross, made in the
      rudest manner, hanging by itself on a slip of wall between two windows. It
      was so strangely rough and misshapen a thing to exhibit prominently in a
      neat room, that I suspected some history must be attached to it, and
      resolved to speak to my friend the nun about it at the earliest
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Martha,&rdquo; said I, taking advantage of the first pause in the
      succession of quaintly innocent questions which she was as usual
      addressing to me, &ldquo;I have been looking at that rough old cross hanging
      between the windows, and fancying that it must surely be some curiosity&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; exclaimed the nun, &ldquo;you must not speak of that as a
      &lsquo;curiosity&rsquo;; the Mother Superior calls it a Relic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I ought to have chosen my expressions more
      carefully&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not,&rdquo; interposed Mother Martha, nodding to show me that my apology need
      not be finished&mdash;&ldquo;not that it is exactly a relic in the strict
      Catholic sense of the word; but there were circumstances in the life of
      the person who made it&mdash;&rdquo; Here she stopped, and looked at me
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circumstances, perhaps, which it is not considered advisable to
      communicate to strangers,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; answered the nun, &ldquo;I never heard that they were to be kept a
      secret. They were not told as a secret to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know all about them?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I could tell you the whole history of the wooden cross; but it
      is all about Catholics, and you are a Protestant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, Mother Martha, does not make it at all less interesting to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it not, indeed?&rdquo; exclaimed the nun, innocently. &ldquo;What a strange man
      you are! and what a remarkable religion yours must be! What do your
      priests say about ours? Are they learned men, your priests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt that my chance of hearing Mother Martha&rsquo;s story would be a poor one
      indeed, if I allowed her to begin a fresh string of questions.
      Accordingly, I dismissed the inquiries about the clergy of the Established
      Church with the most irreverent briefness, and recalled her attention
      forthwith to the subject of the wooden cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the good-natured nun; &ldquo;surely you shall hear all I can
      tell you about it; but&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated timidly, &ldquo;but I must ask the
      Mother Superior&rsquo;s leave first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying these words, she summoned the portress, to my great amusement, to
      keep guard over the inestimable Correggio in her absence, and left the
      room. In less than five minutes she came back, looking quite happy and
      important in her innocent way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Mother Superior,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has given me leave to tell all I know
      about the wooden cross. She says it may do you good, and improve your
      Protestant opinion of us Catholics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I expressed myself as being both willing and anxious to profit by what I
      heard; and the nun began her narrative immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She related it in her own simple, earnest, minute way; dwelling as long on
      small particulars as on important incidents; and making moral reflections
      for my benefit at every place where it was possible to introduce them. In
      spite, however, of these drawbacks in the telling of it, the story
      interested and impressed me in no ordinary degree; and I now purpose
      putting the events of it together as skillfully and strikingly as I can,
      in the hope that this written version of the narrative may appeal as
      strongly to the reader&rsquo;s sympathies as the spoken version did to mine.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One night, during the period of the first French Revolution, the family of
      Francois Sarzeau, a fisherman of Brittany, were all waking and watching at
      a late hour in their cottage on the peninsula of Quiberon. Francois had
      gone out in his boat that evening, as usual, to fish. Shortly after his
      departure, the wind had risen, the clouds had gathered; and the storm,
      which had been threatening at intervals throughout the whole day, burst
      forth furiously about nine o&rsquo;clock. It was now eleven; and the raging of
      the wind over the barren, heathy peninsula still seemed to increase with
      each fresh blast that tore its way out upon the open sea; the crashing of
      the waves on the beach was awful to hear; the dreary blackness of the sky
      terrible to behold. The longer they listened to the storm, the oftener
      they looked out at it, the fainter grew the hopes which the fisherman&rsquo;s
      family still strove to cherish for the safety of Francois Sarzeau and of
      his younger son who had gone with him in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something impressive in the simplicity of the scene that was now
      passing within the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one side of the great, rugged, black fire-place crouched two little
      girls; the younger half asleep, with her head in her sister&rsquo;s lap. These
      were the daughters of the fisherman; and opposite to them sat their eldest
      brother, Gabriel. His right arm had been badly wounded in a recent
      encounter at the national game of the <i>Soule</i>, a sport resembling our
      English foot-ball; but played on both sides in such savage earnest by the
      people of Brittany as to end always in bloodshed, often in mutilation,
      sometimes even in loss of life. On the same bench with Gabriel sat his
      betrothed wife&mdash;a girl of eighteen&mdash;clothed in the plain, almost
      monastic black-and-white costume of her native district. She was the
      daughter of a small farmer living at some little distance from the coast.
      Between the groups formed on either side of the fire-place, the vacant
      space was occupied by the foot of a truckle-bed. In this bed lay a very
      old man, the father of Francois Sarzeau. His haggard face was covered with
      deep wrinkles; his long white hair flowed over the coarse lump of sacking
      which served him for a pillow, and his light gray eyes wandered
      incessantly, with a strange expression of terror and suspicion, from
      person to person, and from object to object, in all parts of the room.
      Whenever the wind and sea whistled and roared at their loudest, he
      muttered to himself and tossed his hands fretfully on his wretched
      coverlet. On these occasions his eyes always fixed themselves intently on
      a little delf image of the Virgin placed in a niche over the fire-place.
      Every time they saw him look in this direction Gabriel and the young girls
      shuddered and crossed themselves; and even the child, who still kept
      awake, imitated their example. There was one bond of feeling at least
      between the old man and his grandchildren, which connected his age and
      their youth unnaturally and closely together. This feeling was reverence
      for the superstitions which had been handed down to them by their
      ancestors from centuries and centuries back, as far even as the age of the
      Druids. The spirit warnings of disaster and death which the old man heard
      in the wailing of the wind, in the crashing of the waves, in the dreary,
      monotonous rattling of the casement, the young man and his affianced wife
      and the little child who cowered by the fireside heard too. All
      differences in sex, in temperament, in years, superstition was strong
      enough to strike down to its own dread level, in the fisherman&rsquo;s cottage,
      on that stormy night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the benches by the fireside and the bed, the only piece of
      furniture in the room was a coarse wooden table, with a loaf of black
      bread, a knife, and a pitcher of cider placed on it. Old nets, coils of
      rope, tattered sails, hung, about the walls and over the wooden partition
      which separated the room into two compartments. Wisps of straw and ears of
      barley drooped down through the rotten rafters and gaping boards that made
      the floor of the granary above.
    </p>
    <p>
      These different objects, and the persons in the cottage, who composed the
      only surviving members of the fisherman&rsquo;s family, were strangely and
      wildly lit up by the blaze of the fire and by the still brighter glare of
      a resin torch stuck into a block of wood in the chimney-corner. The red
      and yellow light played full on the weird face of the old man as he lay
      opposite to it, and glanced fitfully on the figures of the young girl,
      Gabriel, and the two children; the great, gloomy shadows rose and fell,
      and grew and lessened in bulk about the walls like visions of darkness,
      animated by a supernatural specter-life, while the dense obscurity outside
      spreading before the curtainless window seemed as a wall of solid darkness
      that had closed in forever around the fisherman&rsquo;s house. The night scene
      within the cottage was almost as wild and as dreary to look upon as the
      night scene without.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time the different persons in the room sat together without
      speaking, even without looking at each other. At last the girl turned and
      whispered something into Gabriel&rsquo;s ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perrine, what were you saying to Gabriel?&rdquo; asked the child opposite,
      seizing the first opportunity of breaking the desolate silence&mdash;doubly
      desolate at her age&mdash;which was preserved by all around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was telling him,&rdquo; answered Perrine, simply, &ldquo;that it was time to change
      the bandages on his arm; and I also said to him, what I have often said
      before, that he must never play at that terrible game of the <i>Soule</i>
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man had been looking intently at Perrine and his grandchild as
      they spoke. His harsh, hollow voice mingled with the last soft tones of
      the young girl, repeating over and over again the same terrible words,
      &ldquo;Drowned! drowned! Son and grandson, both drowned! both drowned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, grandfather,&rdquo; said Gabriel, &ldquo;we must not lose all hope for them
      yet. God and the Blessed Virgin protect them!&rdquo; He looked at the little
      delf image, and crossed himself; the others imitated him, except the old
      man. He still tossed his hands over the coverlet, and still repeated,
      &ldquo;Drowned! drowned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that accursed <i>Soule!</i>&rdquo; groaned the young man. &ldquo;But for this
      wound I should have been with my father. The poor boy&rsquo;s life might at
      least have been saved; for we should then have left him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; exclaimed the harsh voice from the bed. &ldquo;The wail of dying men
      rises louder than the loud sea; the devil&rsquo;s psalm-singing roars higher
      than the roaring wind! Be silent, and listen! Francois drowned! Pierre
      drowned! Hark! Hark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A terrific blast of wind burst over the house as he spoke, shaking it to
      its center, overpowering all other sounds, even to the deafening crash of
      the waves. The slumbering child awoke, and uttered a scream of fear.
      Perrine, who had been kneeling before her lover binding the fresh bandages
      on his wounded arm, paused in her occupation, trembling from head to foot.
      Gabriel looked toward the window; his experience told him what must be the
      hurricane fury of that blast of wind out at sea, and he sighed bitterly as
      he murmured to himself, &ldquo;God help them both&mdash;man&rsquo;s help will be as
      nothing to them now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel!&rdquo; cried the voice from the bed in altered tones&mdash;very faint
      and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not hear or did not attend to the old man. He was trying to soothe
      and encourage the young girl at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, love,&rdquo; he said, kissing her very gently and tenderly
      on the forehead. &ldquo;You are as safe here as anywhere. Was I not right in
      saying that it would be madness to attempt taking you back to the
      farmhouse this evening? You can sleep in that room, Perrine, when you are
      tired&mdash;you can sleep with the two girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel! brother Gabriel!&rdquo; cried one of the children. &ldquo;Oh, look at
      grandfather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel ran to the bedside. The old man had raised himself into a sitting
      position; his eyes were dilated, his whole face was rigid with terror, his
      hands were stretched out convulsively toward his grandson. &ldquo;The White
      Women!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;The White Women; the grave-diggers of the drowned
      are out on the sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The children, with cries of terror, flung themselves into Perrine&rsquo;s arms;
      even Gabriel uttered an exclamation of horror, and started back from the
      bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the old man reiterated, &ldquo;The White Women! The White Women! Open the
      door, Gabriel! look-out westward, where the ebb-tide has left the sand
      dry. You&rsquo;ll see them bright as lightning in the darkness, mighty as the
      angels in stature, sweeping like the wind over the sea, in their long
      white garments, with their white hair trailing far behind them! Open the
      door, Gabriel! You&rsquo;ll see them stop and hover over the place where your
      father and your brother have been drowned; you&rsquo;ll see them come on till
      they reach the sand, you&rsquo;ll see them dig in it with their naked feet and
      beckon awfully to the raging sea to give up its dead. Open the door,
      Gabriel&mdash;or, though it should be the death of me, I will get up and
      open it myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel&rsquo;s face whitened even to his lips, but he made a sign that he would
      obey. It required the exertion of his whole strength to keep the door open
      against the wind while he looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see them, grandson Gabriel? Speak the truth, and tell me if you
      see them,&rdquo; cried the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see nothing but darkness&mdash;pitch darkness,&rdquo; answered Gabriel,
      letting the door close again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! woe! woe!&rdquo; groaned his grandfather, sinking back exhausted on the
      pillow. &ldquo;Darkness to <i>you;</i> but bright as lightning to the eyes that
      are allowed to see them. Drowned! drowned! Pray for their souls, Gabriel&mdash;<i>I</i>
      see the White Women even where I lie, and dare not pray for them. Son and
      grandson drowned! both drowned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man went back to Perrine and the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather is very ill to-night,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You had better all go
      into the bedroom, and leave me alone to watch by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rose as he spoke, crossed themselves before the image of the Virgin,
      kissed him one by one, and, without uttering a word, softly entered the
      little room on the other side of the partition. Gabriel looked at his
      grandfather, and saw that he lay quiet now, with his eyes closed as if he
      were already dropping asleep. The young man then heaped some fresh logs on
      the fire, and sat down by it to watch till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very dreary was the moaning of the night storm; but it was not more dreary
      than the thoughts which now occupied him in his solitude&mdash;thoughts
      darkened and distorted by the terrible superstitions of his country and
      his race. Ever since the period of his mother&rsquo;s death he had been
      oppressed by the conviction that some curse hung over the family. At first
      they had been prosperous, they had got money, a little legacy had been
      left them. But this good fortune had availed only for a time; disaster on
      disaster strangely and suddenly succeeded. Losses, misfortunes, poverty,
      want itself had overwhelmed them; his father&rsquo;s temper had become so
      soured, that the oldest friends of Francois Sarzeau declared he was
      changed beyond recognition. And now, all this past misfortune&mdash;the
      steady, withering, household blight of many years&mdash;had ended in the
      last, worst misery of all&mdash;in death. The fate of his father and his
      brother admitted no longer of a doubt; he knew it, as he listened to the
      storm, as he reflected on his grandfather&rsquo;s words, as he called to mind
      his own experience of the perils of the sea. And this double bereavement
      had fallen on him just as the time was approaching for his marriage with
      Perrine; just when misfortune was most ominous of evil, just when it was
      hardest to bear! Forebodings, which he dared not realize, began now to
      mingle with the bitterness of his grief, whenever his thoughts wandered
      from the present to the future; and as he sat by the lonely fireside,
      murmuring from time to time the Church prayer for the repose of the dead,
      he almost involuntarily mingled with it another prayer, expressed only in
      his own simple words, for the safety of the living&mdash;for the young
      girl whose love was his sole earthly treasure; for the motherless children
      who must now look for protection to him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had sat by the hearth a long, long time, absorbed in his thoughts, not
      once looking round toward the bed, when he was startled by hearing the
      sound of his grandfather&rsquo;s voice once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel,&rdquo; whispered the old man, trembling and shrinking as he spoke,
      &ldquo;Gabriel, do you hear a dripping of water&mdash;now slow, now quick again&mdash;on
      the floor at the foot of my bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear nothing, grandfather, but the crackling of the fire, and the
      roaring of the storm outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drip, drip, drip! Faster and faster; plainer and plainer. Take the torch,
      Gabriel; look down on the floor&mdash;look with all your eyes. Is the
      place wet there? Is it the rain from heaven that is dropping through the
      roof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel took the torch with trembling fingers and knelt down on the floor
      to examine it closely. He started back from the place, as he saw that it
      was quite dry&mdash;the torch dropped upon the hearth&mdash;he fell on his
      knees before the statue of the Virgin and hid his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the floor wet? Answer me, I command you&mdash;is the floor wet?&rdquo; asked
      the old man, quickly and breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel rose, went back to the bedside, and whispered to him that no drop
      of rain had fallen inside the cottage. As he spoke the words, he saw a
      change pass over his grandfather&rsquo;s face&mdash;the sharp features seemed to
      wither up on a sudden; the eager expression to grow vacant and death-like
      in an instant. The voice, too, altered; it was harsh and querulous no
      more; its tones became strangely soft, slow, and solemn, when the old man
      spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear it still,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;drip! drip! faster and plainer than ever.
      That ghostly dropping of water is the last and the surest of the fatal
      signs which have told of your father&rsquo;s and your brother&rsquo;s deaths to-night,
      and I know from the place where I hear it&mdash;the foot of the bed I lie
      on&mdash;that it is a warning to me of my own approaching end. I am called
      where my son and my grandson have gone before me; my weary time in this
      world is over at last. Don&rsquo;t let Perrine and the children come in here, if
      they should awake&mdash;they are too young to look at death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel&rsquo;s blood curdled when he heard these words&mdash;when he touched
      his grandfather&rsquo;s hand, and felt the chill that it struck to his own&mdash;when
      he listened to the raging wind, and knew that all help was miles and miles
      away from the cottage. Still, in spite of the storm, the darkness, and the
      distance, he thought not for a moment of neglecting the duty that had been
      taught him from his childhood&mdash;the duty of summoning the priest to
      the bedside of the dying. &ldquo;I must call Perrine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to watch by you
      while I am away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;Stop, Gabriel; I implore, I command you not to
      leave me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priest, grandfather&mdash;your confession&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be made to you. In this darkness and this hurricane no man can
      keep the path across the heath. Gabriel, I am dying&mdash;I should be dead
      before you got back. Gabriel, for the love of the Blessed Virgin, stop
      here with me till I die&mdash;my time is short&mdash;I have a terrible
      secret that I must tell to somebody before I draw my last breath! Your ear
      to my mouth&mdash;quick! quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the last words, a slight noise was audible on the other side
      of the partition, the door half opened, and Perrine appeared at it,
      looking affrightedly into the room. The vigilant eyes of the old man&mdash;suspicious
      even in death&mdash;caught sight of her directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back!&rdquo; he exclaimed faintly, before she could utter a word; &ldquo;go back&mdash;push
      her back, Gabriel, and nail down the latch in the door, if she won&rsquo;t shut
      it of herself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Perrine! go in again,&rdquo; implored Gabriel. &ldquo;Go in, and keep the
      children from disturbing us. You will only make him worse&mdash;you can be
      of no use here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed without speaking, and shut the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the old man clutched him by the arm, and repeated, &ldquo;Quick! quick!
      your ear close to my mouth,&rdquo; Gabriel heard her say to the children (who
      were both awake), &ldquo;Let us pray for grandfather.&rdquo; And as he knelt down by
      the bedside, there stole on his ear the sweet, childish tones of his
      little sisters, and the soft, subdued voice of the young girl who was
      teaching them the prayer, mingling divinely with the solemn wailing of
      wind and sea, rising in a still and awful purity over the hoarse, gasping
      whispers of the dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took an oath not to tell it, Gabriel&mdash;lean down closer! I&rsquo;m weak,
      and they mustn&rsquo;t hear a word in that room&mdash;I took an oath not to tell
      it; but death is a warrant to all men for breaking such an oath as that.
      Listen; don&rsquo;t lose a word I&rsquo;m saying! Don&rsquo;t look away into the room: the
      stain of blood-guilt has defiled it forever! Hush! hush! hush! Let me
      speak. Now your father&rsquo;s dead, I can&rsquo;t carry the horrid secret with me
      into the grave. Just remember, Gabriel&mdash;try if you can&rsquo;t remember the
      time before I was bedridden, ten years ago and more&mdash;it was about six
      weeks, you know, before your mother&rsquo;s death; you can remember it by that.
      You and all the children were in that room with your mother; you were
      asleep, I think; it was night, not very late&mdash;only nine o&rsquo;clock. Your
      father and I were standing at the door, looking out at the heath in the
      moonlight. He was so poor at that time, he had been obliged to sell his
      own boat, and none of the neighbors would take him out fishing with them&mdash;your
      father wasn&rsquo;t liked by any of the neighbors. Well; we saw a stranger
      coming toward us; a very young man, with a knapsack on his back. He looked
      like a gentleman, though he was but poorly dressed. He came up, and told
      us he was dead tired, and didn&rsquo;t think he could reach the town that night
      and asked if we would give him shelter till morning. And your father said
      yes, if he would make no noise, because the wife was ill, and the children
      were asleep. So he said all he wanted was to go to sleep himself before
      the fire. We had nothing to give him but black bread. He had better food
      with him than that, and undid his knapsack to get at it, and&mdash;and&mdash;Gabriel!
      I&rsquo;m sinking&mdash;drink! something to drink&mdash;I&rsquo;m parched with
      thirst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silent and deadly pale, Gabriel poured some of the cider from the pitcher
      on the table into a drinking-cup, and gave it to the old man. Slight as
      the stimulant was, its effect on him was almost instantaneous. His dull
      eyes brightened a little, and he went on in the same whispering tones as
      before:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He pulled the food out of his knapsack rather in a hurry, so that some of
      the other small things in it fell on the floor. Among these was a
      pocketbook, which your father picked up and gave him back; and he put it
      in his coat-pocket&mdash;there was a tear in one of the sides of the book,
      and through the hole some bank-notes bulged out. I saw them, and so did
      your father (don&rsquo;t move away, Gabriel; keep close, there&rsquo;s nothing in me
      to shrink from). Well, he shared his food, like an honest fellow, with us;
      and then put his hand in his pocket, and gave me four or five livres, and
      then lay down before the fire to go to sleep. As he shut his eyes, your
      father looked at me in a way I didn&rsquo;t like. He&rsquo;d been behaving very
      bitterly and desperately toward us for some time past, being soured about
      poverty, and your mother&rsquo;s illness, and the constant crying out of you
      children for more to eat. So when he told me to go and buy some wood, some
      bread, and some wine with money I had got, I didn&rsquo;t like, somehow, to
      leave him alone with the stranger; and so made excuses, saying (which was
      true) that it was too late to buy things in the village that night. But he
      told me in a rage to go and do as he bid me, and knock the people up if
      the shop was shut. So I went out, being dreadfully afraid of your father&mdash;as
      indeed we all were at that time&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind to go
      far from the house; I was afraid of something happening, though I didn&rsquo;t
      dare to think what. I don&rsquo;t know how it was, but I stole back in about ten
      minutes on tiptoe to the cottage; I looked in at the window, and saw&mdash;O
      God! forgive him! O God! forgive me!&mdash;I saw&mdash;I&mdash;more to
      drink, Gabriel! I can&rsquo;t speak again&mdash;more to drink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voices in the next room had ceased; but in the minute of silence which
      now ensued, Gabriel heard his sisters kissing Perrine, and wishing her
      good-night. They were all three trying to go asleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel, pray yourself, and teach your children after you to pray, that
      your father may find forgiveness where he is now gone. I saw him as
      plainly as I now see you, kneeling with his knife in one hand over the
      sleeping man. He was taking the little book with the notes in it out of
      the stranger&rsquo;s pocket. He got the book into his possession, and held it
      quite still in his hand for an instant, thinking. I believe&mdash;oh no!
      no! I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;he was repenting; I&rsquo;m sure he was going to put the book
      back; but just at that moment the stranger moved, and raised one of his
      arms, as if he was waking up. Then the temptation of the devil grew too
      strong for your father&mdash;I saw him lift the hand with the knife in it&mdash;but
      saw nothing more. I couldn&rsquo;t look in at the window&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t move
      away&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t cry out; I stood with my back turned toward the
      house, shivering all over, though it was a warm summer-time, and hearing
      no cries, no noises at all, from the room behind me. I was too frightened
      to know how long it was before the opening of the cottage door made me
      turn round; but when I did, I saw your father standing before me in the
      yellow moonlight, carrying in his arms the bleeding body of the poor lad
      who had shared his food with us and slept on our hearth. Hush! hush! Don&rsquo;t
      groan and sob in that way! Stifle it with the bedclothes. Hush! you&rsquo;ll
      wake them in the next room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel&mdash;Gabriel!&rdquo; exclaimed a voice from behind the partition.
      &ldquo;What has happened? Gabriel! let me come out and be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; cried the old man, collecting the last remains of his strength
      in the attempt to speak above the wind, which was just then howling at the
      loudest; &ldquo;stay where you are&mdash;don&rsquo;t speak, don&rsquo;t come out&mdash;I
      command you! Gabriel&rdquo; (his voice dropped to a faint whisper), &ldquo;raise me up
      in bed&mdash;you must hear the whole of it now; raise me; I&rsquo;m choking so
      that I can hardly speak. Keep close and listen&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say much
      more. Where was I?&mdash;Ah, your father! He threatened to kill me if I
      didn&rsquo;t swear to keep it secret; and in terror of my life I swore. He made
      me help him to carry the body&mdash;we took it all across the heath&mdash;oh!
      horrible, horrible, under the bright moon&mdash;(lift me higher, Gabriel).
      You know the great stones yonder, set up by the heathens; you know the
      hollow place under the stones they call &lsquo;The Merchant&rsquo;s Table&rsquo;; we had
      plenty of room to lay him in that, and hide him so; and then we ran back
      to the cottage. I never dared to go near the place afterward; no, nor your
      father either! (Higher, Gabriel! I&rsquo;m choking again.) We burned the
      pocket-book and the knapsack&mdash;never knew his name&mdash;we kept the
      money to spend. (You&rsquo;re not lifting me; you&rsquo;re not listening close
      enough!) Your father said it was a legacy, when you and your mother asked
      about the money. (You hurt me, you shake me to pieces, Gabriel, when you
      sob like that.) It brought a curse on us, the money; the curse has drowned
      your father and your brother; the curse is killing me; but I&rsquo;ve confessed&mdash;tell
      the priest I confessed before I died. Stop her; stop Perrine! I hear her
      getting up. Take his bones away from the Merchant&rsquo;s Table, and bury them
      for the love of God! and tell the priest (lift me higher, lift me till I
      am on my knees)&mdash;if your father was alive, he&rsquo;d murder me; but tell
      the priest&mdash;because of my guilty soul&mdash;to pray, and&mdash;remember
      the Merchant&rsquo;s Table&mdash;to bury, and to pray&mdash;to pray always for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As long as Perrine heard faintly the whispering of the old man, though no
      word that he said reached her ear, she shrank from opening the door in the
      partition. But, when the whispering sounds, which terrified her she knew
      not how or why, first faltered, then ceased altogether; when she heard the
      sobs that followed them; and when her heart told her who was weeping in
      the next room&mdash;then, she began to be influenced by a new feeling
      which was stronger than the strongest fear, and she opened the door
      without hesitation, almost without trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coverlet was drawn up over the old man; Gabriel was kneeling by the
      bedside, with his face hidden. When she spoke to him, he neither answered
      nor looked at her. After a while the sobs that shook him ceased; but still
      he never moved, except once when she touched him, and then he shuddered&mdash;shuddered
      under <i>her</i> hand! She called in his little sisters, and they spoke to
      him, and still he uttered no word in reply. They wept. One by one, often
      and often, they entreated him with loving words; but the stupor of grief
      which held him speechless and motionless was beyond the power of human
      tears, stronger even than the strength of human love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was near daybreak, and the storm was lulling, but still no change
      occurred at the bedside. Once or twice, as Perrine knelt near Gabriel,
      still vainly endeavoring to arouse him to a sense of her presence, she
      thought she heard the old man breathing feebly, and stretched out her hand
      toward the coverlet; but she could not summon courage to touch him or to
      look at him. This was the first time she had ever been present at a
      death-bed; the stillness in the room, the stupor of despair that had
      seized on Gabriel, so horrified her, that she was almost as helpless as
      the two children by her side. It was not till the dawn looked in at the
      cottage window&mdash;so coldly, so drearily, and yet so re-assuringly&mdash;that
      she began to recover her self-possession at all. Then she knew that her
      best resource would be to summon assistance immediately from the nearest
      house. While she was trying to persuade the two children to remain alone
      in the cottage with Gabriel during her temporary absence, she was startled
      by the sound of footsteps outside the door. It opened, and a man appeared
      on the threshold, standing still there for a moment in the dim, uncertain
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked closer&mdash;looked intently at him. It was Francois Sarzeau
      himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The fisherman was dripping with wet; but his face, always pale and
      inflexible, seemed to be but little altered in expression by the perils
      through which he must have passed during the night. Young Pierre lay
      almost insensible in his arms. In the astonishment and fright of the first
      moment, Perrine screamed as she recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, there!&rdquo; he said, peevishly, advancing straight to the
      hearth with his burden; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make a noise. You never expected to see us
      alive again, I dare say. We gave ourselves up as lost, and only escaped
      after all by a miracle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid the boy down where he could get the full warmth of the fire; and
      then, turning round, took a wicker-covered bottle from his pocket, and
      said, &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the brandy&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped suddenly&mdash;started&mdash;put
      down the bottle on the bench near him&mdash;and advanced quickly to the
      bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrine looked after him as he went; and saw Gabriel, who had risen when
      the door was opened, moving back from the bed as Francois approached. The
      young man&rsquo;s face seemed to have been suddenly struck to stone&mdash;its
      blank, ghastly whiteness was awful to look at. He moved slowly backward
      and backward till he came to the cottage wall&mdash;then stood quite
      still, staring on his father with wild, vacant eyes, moving his hands to
      and fro before him, muttering, but never pronouncing one audible word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francois did not appear to notice his son; he had the coverlet of the bed
      in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything the matter here?&rdquo; he asked, as he drew it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Gabriel could not speak. Perrine saw it, and answered for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel is afraid that his poor grandfather is dead,&rdquo; she whispered,
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; There was no sorrow in the tone as he echoed the word. &ldquo;Was he
      very bad in the night before his death happened? Did he wander in his
      mind? He has been rather light-headed lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very restless, and spoke of the ghostly warnings that we all know
      of; he said he saw and heard many things which told him from the other
      world that you and Pierre&mdash;Gabriel!&rdquo; she screamed, suddenly
      interrupting herself, &ldquo;look at him! Look at his face! Your grandfather is
      not dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Francois was raising his father&rsquo;s head to look closely at
      him. A faint spasm had indeed passed over the deathly face; the lips
      quivered, the jaw dropped. Francois shuddered as he looked, and moved away
      hastily from the bed. At the same instant Gabriel started from the wall;
      his expression altered, his pale cheeks flushed suddenly, as he snatched
      up the wicker-cased bottle, and poured all the little brandy that was left
      in it down his grandfather&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect was nearly instantaneous; the sinking vital forces rallied
      desperately. The old man&rsquo;s eyes opened again, wandered round the room,
      then fixed themselves intently on Francois as he stood near the fire.
      Trying and terrible as his position was at that moment, Gabriel still
      retained self-possession enough to whisper a few words in Perrine&rsquo;s ear.
      &ldquo;Go back again into the bedroom, and take the children with you,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;We may have something to speak about which you had better not hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son Gabriel, your grandfather is trembling all over,&rdquo; said Francois. &ldquo;If
      he is dying at all, he is dying of cold; help me to lift him, bed and all,
      to the hearth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! don&rsquo;t let him touch me!&rdquo; gasped the old man. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him look
      at me in that way! Don&rsquo;t let him come near me, Gabriel! Is it his ghost?
      or is it himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Gabriel answered he heard a knocking at the door. His father opened it,
      and disclosed to view some people from the neighboring fishing village,
      who had come&mdash;more out of curiosity than sympathy&mdash;to inquire
      whether Francois and the boy Pierre had survived the night. Without asking
      any one to enter, the fisherman surlily and shortly answered the various
      questions addressed to him, standing in his own doorway. While he was thus
      engaged, Gabriel heard his grandfather muttering vacantly to himself,
      &ldquo;Last night&mdash;how about last night, grandson? What was I talking about
      last night? Did I say your father was drowned? Very foolish to say he was
      drowned, and then see him come back alive again! But it wasn&rsquo;t that&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      so weak in my head, I can&rsquo;t remember. What was it, Gabriel? Something too
      horrible to speak of? Is that what you&rsquo;re whispering and trembling about?
      I said nothing horrible. A crime! Bloodshed! I know nothing of any crime
      or bloodshed here&mdash;I must have been frightened out of my wits to talk
      in that way! The Merchant&rsquo;s Table? Only a big heap of old stones! What
      with the storm, and thinking I was going to die, and being afraid about
      your father, I must have been light-headed. Don&rsquo;t give another thought to
      that nonsense, Gabriel! I&rsquo;m better now. We shall all live to laugh at poor
      grandfather for talking nonsense about crime and bloodshed in his sleep.
      Ah, poor old man&mdash;last night&mdash;light-headed&mdash;fancies and
      nonsense of an old man&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you laugh at it? I&rsquo;m laughing&mdash;so
      light-headed, so light&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly. A low cry, partly of terror and partly of pain,
      escaped him; the look of pining anxiety and imbecile cunning which had
      distorted his face while he had been speaking, faded from it forever. He
      shivered a little, breathed heavily once or twice, then became quite
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he died with a falsehood on his lips?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel looked round and saw that the cottage door was closed, and that
      his father was standing against it. How long he had occupied that
      position, how many of the old man&rsquo;s last words he had heard, it was
      impossible to conjecture, but there was a lowering suspicion in his harsh
      face as he now looked away from the corpse to his son, which made Gabriel
      shudder; and the first question that he asked, on once more approaching
      the bedside, was expressed in tones which, quiet as they were, had a
      fearful meaning in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did your grandfather talk about last night?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel did not answer. All that he had heard, all that he had seen, all
      the misery and horror that might yet be to come, had stunned his mind. The
      unspeakable dangers of his present position were too tremendous to be
      realized. He could only feel them vaguely in the weary torpor that
      oppressed his heart; while in every other direction the use of his
      faculties, physical and mental, seemed to have suddenly and totally
      abandoned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your tongue wounded, son Gabriel, as well as your arm?&rdquo; his father
      went on, with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;I come back to you, saved by a miracle; and
      you never speak to me. Would you rather I had died than the old man there?
      He can&rsquo;t hear you now&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t you tell me what nonsense he was
      talking last night? You won&rsquo;t? I say you shall!&rdquo; (He crossed the room and
      put his back to the door.) &ldquo;Before either of us leave this place, you
      shall confess it! You know that my duty to the Church bids me to go at
      once and tell the priest of your grandfather&rsquo;s death. If I leave that duty
      unfulfilled, remember it is through your fault! <i>You</i> keep me here&mdash;for
      here I stop till I&rsquo;m obeyed. Do you hear that, idiot? Speak! Speak
      instantly, or you shall repeat it to the day of your death! I ask again&mdash;what
      did your grandfather say to you when he was wandering in his mind last
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke of a crime committed by another, and guiltily kept secret by
      him,&rdquo; answered Gabriel, slowly and sternly. &ldquo;And this morning he denied
      his own words with his last living breath. But last night, if he spoke the
      truth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth!&rdquo; echoed Francois. &ldquo;What truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, his eyes fell, then turned toward the corpse. For a few
      minutes he stood steadily contemplating it; breathing quickly, and drawing
      his hand several times across his forehead. Then he faced his son once
      more. In that short interval he had become in outward appearance a changed
      man; expression, voice, and manner, all were altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forgive me!&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but I could almost laugh at myself, at
      this solemn moment, for having spoken and acted just now so much like a
      fool! Denied his words, did he? Poor old man! they say sense often comes
      back to light-headed people just before death; and he is a proof of it.
      The fact is, Gabriel, my own wits must have been a little shaken&mdash;and
      no wonder&mdash;by what I went through last night, and what I have come
      home to this morning. As if you, or anybody, could ever really give
      serious credit to the wandering speeches of a dying old man! (Where is
      Perrine? Why did you send her away?) I don&rsquo;t wonder at your still looking
      a little startled, and feeling low in your mind, and all that&mdash;for
      you&rsquo;ve had a trying night of it, trying in every way. He must have been a
      good deal shaken in his wits last night, between fears about himself and
      fears about me. (To think of my being angry with you, Gabriel, for being a
      little alarmed&mdash;very naturally&mdash;by an old man&rsquo;s queer fancies!)
      Come out, Perrine&mdash;come out of the bedroom whenever you are tired of
      it: you must learn sooner or later to look at death calmly. Shake hands,
      Gabriel; and let us make it up, and say no more about what has passed. You
      won&rsquo;t? Still angry with me for what I said to you just now? Ah! you&rsquo;ll
      think better about it by the time I return. Come out, Perrine; we&rsquo;ve no
      secrets here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo; asked Gabriel, as he saw his father hastily open
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the priest that one of his congregation is dead, and to have the
      death registered,&rdquo; answered Francois. &ldquo;These are <i>my</i> duties, and
      must be performed before I take any rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out hurriedly as he said these words. Gabriel almost trembled at
      himself when he found that he breathed more freely, that he felt less
      horribly oppressed both in mind and body, the moment his father&rsquo;s back was
      turned. Fearful as thought was now, it was still a change for the better
      to be capable of thinking at all. Was the behavior of his father
      compatible with innocence? Could the old man&rsquo;s confused denial of his own
      words in the morning, and in the presence of his son, be set for one
      instant against the circumstantial confession that he had made during the
      night alone with his grandson? These were the terrible questions which
      Gabriel now asked himself, and which he shrank involuntarily from
      answering. And yet that doubt, the solution of which would, one way or the
      other, irrevocably affect the whole future of his life, must sooner or
      later be solved at any hazard!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there any way of setting it at rest? Yes, one way&mdash;to go
      instantly, while his father was absent, and examine the hollow place under
      the Merchant&rsquo;s Table. If his grandfather&rsquo;s confession had really been made
      while he was in possession of his senses, this place (which Gabriel knew
      to be covered in from wind and weather) had never been visited since the
      commission of the crime by the perpetrator, or by his unwilling
      accomplice; though time had destroyed all besides, the hair and the bones
      of the victim would still be left to bear witness to the truth&mdash;if
      truth had indeed been spoken. As this conviction grew on him, the young
      man&rsquo;s cheek paled; and he stopped irresolute half-way between the hearth
      and the door. Then he looked down doubtfully at the corpse on the bed; and
      then there came upon him suddenly a revulsion of feeling. A wild, feverish
      impatience to know the worst without another instant of delay possessed
      him. Only telling Perrine that he should be back soon, and that she must
      watch by the dead in his absence, he left the cottage at once, without
      waiting to hear her reply, even without looking back as he closed the door
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two tracks to the Merchant&rsquo;s Table. One, the longer of the two,
      by the coast cliffs; the other across the heath. But this latter path was
      also, for some little distance, the path which led to the village and the
      church. He was afraid of attracting his father&rsquo;s attention here, so he
      took the direction of the coast. At one spot the track trended inland,
      winding round some of the many Druid monuments scattered over the country.
      This place was on high ground, and commanded a view, at no great distance,
      of the path leading to the village, just where it branched off from the
      heathy ridge which ran in the direction of the Merchant&rsquo;s Table. Here
      Gabriel descried the figure of a man standing with his back toward the
      coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      This figure was too far off to be identified with absolute certainty, but
      it looked like, and might well be, Francois Sarzeau. Whoever he was, the
      man was evidently uncertain which way he should proceed. When he moved
      forward, it was first to advance several paces toward the Merchant&rsquo;s
      Table; then he went back again toward the distant cottages and the church.
      Twice he hesitated thus; the second time pausing long before he appeared
      finally to take the way that led to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the post of observation among the stones, at which he had
      instinctively halted for some minutes past, Gabriel now proceeded on his
      own path. Could this man really be his father? And if it were so, why did
      Francois Sarzeau only determine to go to the village where his business
      lay, after having twice vainly attempted to persevere in taking the
      exactly opposite direction of the Merchant&rsquo;s Table? Did he really desire
      to go there? Had he heard the name mentioned, when the old man referred to
      it in his dying words? And had he failed to summon courage enough to make
      all safe by removing&mdash;This last question was too horrible to be
      pursued; Gabriel stifled it affrightedly in his own heart as he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the great Druid monument without meeting a living soul on his
      way. The sun was rising, and the mighty storm-clouds of the night were
      parting asunder wildly over the whole eastward horizon. The waves still
      leaped and foamed gloriously: but the gale had sunk to a keen, fresh
      breeze. As Gabriel looked up, and saw how brightly the promise of a lovely
      day was written in the heavens, he trembled as he thought of the search
      which he was now about to make. The sight of the fair, fresh sunrise
      jarred horribly with the suspicions of committed murder that were rankling
      foully in his heart. But he knew that his errand must be performed, and he
      nerved himself to go through with it; for he dared not return to the
      cottage until the mystery had been cleared up at once and forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Merchant&rsquo;s Table was formed by two huge stones resting horizontally on
      three others. In the troubled times of more than half a century ago,
      regular tourists were unknown among the Druid monuments of Brittany; and
      the entrance to the hollow place under the stones&mdash;since often
      visited by strangers&mdash;was at this time nearly choked up by brambles
      and weeds. Gabriel&rsquo;s first look at this tangled nook of briers convinced
      him that the place had not been entered perhaps for years, by any living
      being. Without allowing himself to hesitate (for he felt that the
      slightest delay might be fatal to his resolution), he passed as gently as
      possible through the brambles, and knelt down at the low, dusky, irregular
      entrance of the hollow place under the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart throbbed violently, his breath almost failed him; but he forced
      himself to crawl a few feet into the cavity, and then groped with his hand
      on the ground about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched something! Something which it made his flesh creep to handle;
      something which he would fain have dropped, but which he grasped tight in
      spite of himself. He drew back into the outer air and sunshine. Was it a
      human bone? No! he had been the dupe of his own morbid terror&mdash;he had
      only taken up a fragment of dried wood!
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling shame at such self-deception as this, he was about to throw the
      wood from him before he re-entered the place, when another idea occurred
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was dimly lighted through one or two chinks in the stones, the
      far part of the interior of the cavity was still too dusky to admit of
      perfect examination by the eye, even on a bright sunshiny morning.
      Observing this, he took out the tinder-box and matches, which, like the
      other inhabitants of the district, he always carried about with him for
      the purpose of lighting his pipe, determining to use the piece of wood as
      a torch which might illuminate the darkest corner of the place when he
      next entered it. Fortunately the wood had remained so long and had been
      preserved so dry in its sheltered position, that it caught fire almost as
      easily as a piece of paper. The moment it was fairly aflame Gabriel went
      into the cavity, penetrating at once&mdash;this time&mdash;to its furthest
      extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained among the stones long enough for the wood to burn down nearly
      to his hand. When he came out, and flung the burning fragment from him,
      his face was flushed deeply, his eyes sparkled. He leaped carelessly on to
      the heath, over the bushes through which he had threaded his way so warily
      but a few minutes before, exclaiming, &ldquo;I may marry Perrine with a clear
      conscience now; I am the son of as honest a man as there is in Brittany!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had closely examined the cavity in every corner, and not the slightest
      sign that any dead body had ever been laid there was visible in the hollow
      place under the Merchant&rsquo;s Table.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;I may marry Perrine with a clear conscience now!&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      There are some parts of the world where it would be drawing no natural
      picture of human nature to represent a son as believing conscientiously
      that an offense against life and the laws of hospitality, secretly
      committed by his father, rendered him, though innocent of all
      participation in it, unworthy to fulfill his engagement with his affianced
      wife. Among the simple inhabitants of Gabriel&rsquo;s province, however, such
      acuteness of conscientious sensibility as this was no extraordinary
      exception to all general rules. Ignorant and superstitious as they might
      be, the people of Brittany practiced the duties of hospitality as devoutly
      as they practiced the duties of the national religion. The presence of the
      stranger-guest, rich or poor, was a sacred presence at their hearths. His
      safety was their especial charge, his property their especial
      responsibility. They might be half starved, but they were ready to share
      the last crust with him, nevertheless, as they would share it with their
      own children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any outrage on the virtue of hospitality, thus born and bred in the
      people, was viewed by them with universal disgust, and punished with
      universal execration. This ignominy was uppermost in Gabriel&rsquo;s thoughts by
      the side of his grandfather&rsquo;s bed; the dread of this worst dishonor, which
      there was no wiping out, held him speechless before Perrine, shamed and
      horrified him so that he felt unworthy to look her in the face; and when
      the result of his search at the Merchant&rsquo;s Table proved the absence there
      of all evidence of the crime spoken of by the old man, the blessed relief,
      the absorbing triumph of that discovery, was expressed entirely in the one
      thought which had prompted his first joyful words: He could marry Perrine
      with a clear conscience, for he was the son of an honest man!
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to the cottage, Francois had not come back. Perrine was
      astonished at the change in Gabriel&rsquo;s manner; even Pierre and the children
      remarked it. Rest and warmth had by this time so far recovered the younger
      brother, that he was able to give some account of the perilous adventures
      of the night at sea. They were still listening to the boy&rsquo;s narrative when
      Francois at last returned. It was now Gabriel who held out his hand, and
      made the first advances toward reconciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his utter amazement, his father recoiled from him. The variable temper
      of Francois had evidently changed completely during his absence at the
      village. A settled scowl of distrust darkened his face as he looked at his
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never shake hands with people who have once doubted me,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      loudly and irritably; &ldquo;for I always doubt them forever after. You are a
      bad son! You have suspected your father of some infamy that you dare not
      openly charge him with, on no other testimony than the rambling nonsense
      of a half-witted, dying old man. Don&rsquo;t speak to me! I won&rsquo;t hear you! An
      innocent man and a spy are bad company. Go and denounce me, you Judas in
      disguise! I don&rsquo;t care for your secret or for you. What&rsquo;s that girl
      Perrine doing here still? Why hasn&rsquo;t she gone home long ago? The priest&rsquo;s
      coming; we don&rsquo;t want strangers in the house of death. Take her back to
      the farmhouse, and stop there with her, if you like; nobody wants you
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the manner and look of the speaker as he uttered
      these words, so strange, so sinister, so indescribably suggestive of his
      meaning much more than he said, that Gabriel felt his heart sink within
      him instantly; and almost at the same moment this fearful question forced
      itself irresistibly on his mind: might not his father have followed him to
      the Merchant&rsquo;s Table?
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if he had been desired to speak, he could not have spoken now, while
      that question and the suspicion that it brought with it were utterly
      destroying all the re-assuring hopes and convictions of the morning. The
      mental suffering produced by the sudden change from pleasure to pain in
      all his thoughts, reacted on him physically. He felt as if he were
      stifling in the air of the cottage, in the presence of his father; and
      when Perrine hurried on her walking attire, and with a face which
      alternately flushed and turned pale with every moment, approached the
      door, he went out with her as hastily as if he had been flying from his
      home. Never had the fresh air and the free daylight felt like heavenly and
      guardian influences to him until now!
    </p>
    <p>
      He could comfort Perrine under his father&rsquo;s harshness, he could assure her
      of his own affection, which no earthly influence could change, while they
      walked together toward the farmhouse; but he could do no more. He durst
      not confide to her the subject that was uppermost in his mind; of all
      human beings she was the last to whom he could reveal the terrible secret
      that was festering at his heart. As soon as they got within sight of the
      farmhouse, Gabriel stopped; and, promising to see her again soon, took
      leave of Perrine with assumed ease in his manner and with real despair in
      his heart. Whatever the poor girl might think of it, he felt, at that
      moment, that he had not courage to face her father, and hear him talk
      happily and pleasantly, as his custom was, of Perrine&rsquo;s approaching
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, Gabriel wandered hither and thither over the open heath,
      neither knowing nor caring in what direction he turned his steps. The
      doubts about his father&rsquo;s innocence which had been dissipated by his visit
      to the Merchant&rsquo;s Table, that father&rsquo;s own language and manner had now
      revived&mdash;had even confirmed, though he dared not yet acknowledge so
      much to himself. It was terrible enough to be obliged to admit that the
      result of his morning&rsquo;s search was, after all, not conclusive&mdash;that
      the mystery was, in very truth, not yet cleared up. The violence of his
      father&rsquo;s last words of distrust; the extraordinary and indescribable
      changes in his father&rsquo;s manner while uttering them&mdash;what did these
      things mean? Guilt or innocence? Again, was it any longer reasonable to
      doubt the death-bed confession made by his grandfather? Was it not, on the
      contrary, far more probable that the old man&rsquo;s denial in the morning of
      his own words at night had been made under the influence of a panic
      terror, when his moral consciousness was bewildered, and his intellectual
      faculties were sinking? The longer Gabriel thought of these questions, the
      less competent&mdash;possibly also the less willing&mdash;he felt to
      answer them. Should he seek advice from others wiser than he? No; not
      while the thousandth part of a chance remained that his father was
      innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This thought was still in his mind, when he found himself once more in
      sight of his home. He was still hesitating near the door, when he saw it
      opened cautiously. His brother Pierre looked out, and then came running
      toward him. &ldquo;Come in, Gabriel; oh, do come in!&rdquo; said the boy, earnestly.
      &ldquo;We are afraid to be alone with father. He&rsquo;s been beating us for talking
      of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel went in. His father looked up from the hearth where he was
      sitting, muttered the word &ldquo;Spy!&rdquo; and made a gesture of contempt but did
      not address a word directly to his son. The hours passed on in silence;
      afternoon waned into evening, and evening into night; and still he never
      spoke to any of his children. Soon after it was dark, he went out, and
      took his net with him, saying that it was better to be alone on the sea
      than in the house with a spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned the next morning there was no change in him. Days passed&mdash;weeks,
      months, even elapsed, and still, though his manner insensibly became what
      it used to be toward his other children, it never altered toward his
      eldest son. At the rare periods when they now met, except when absolutely
      obliged to speak, he preserved total silence in his intercourse with
      Gabriel. He would never take Gabriel out with him in the boat; he would
      never sit alone with Gabriel in the house; he would never eat a meal with
      Gabriel; he would never let the other children talk to him about Gabriel;
      and he would never hear a word in expostulation, a word in reference to
      anything his dead father had said or done on the night of the storm, from
      Gabriel himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man pined and changed, so that even Perrine hardly knew him
      again, under this cruel system of domestic excommunication; under the
      wearing influence of the one unchanging doubt which never left him; and,
      more than all, under the incessant reproaches of his own conscience,
      aroused by the sense that he was evading a responsibility which it was his
      solemn, his immediate duty to undertake. But no sting of conscience, no
      ill treatment at home, and no self-reproaches for failing in his duty of
      confession as a good Catholic, were powerful enough in their influence
      over Gabriel to make him disclose the secret, under the oppression of
      which his very life was wasting away. He knew that if he once revealed it,
      whether his father was ultimately proved to be guilty or innocent, there
      would remain a slur and a suspicion on the family, and on Perrine besides,
      from her approaching connection with it, which in their time and in their
      generation could never be removed. The reproach of the world is terrible
      even in the crowded city, where many of the dwellers in our abiding-place
      are strangers to us&mdash;but it is far more terrible in the country,
      where none near us are strangers, where all talk of us and know of us,
      where nothing intervenes between us and the tyranny of the evil tongue.
      Gabriel had not courage to face this, and dare the fearful chance of
      life-long ignominy&mdash;no, not even to serve the sacred interests of
      justice, of atonement, and of truth.

      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Gabriel still remained prostrated under the affliction that was
      wasting his energies of body and mind, Brittany was visited by a great
      public calamity, in which all private misfortunes were overwhelmed for a
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now the time when the ever-gathering storm of the French Revolution
      had risen to its hurricane climax. Those chiefs of the new republic were
      in power whose last, worst madness it was to decree the extinction of
      religion and the overthrow of everything that outwardly symbolized it
      throughout the whole of the country that they governed. Already this
      decree had been executed to the letter in and around Paris; and now the
      soldiers of the Republic were on their way to Brittany, headed by
      commanders whose commission was to root out the Christian religion in the
      last and the surest of the strongholds still left to it in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men began their work in a spirit worthy of the worst of their
      superiors who had sent them to do it. They gutted churches, they
      demolished chapels, they overthrew road-side crosses wherever they found
      them. The terrible guillotine devoured human lives in the villages of
      Brittany as it had devoured them in the streets of Paris; the musket and
      the sword, in highway and byway, wreaked havoc on the people&mdash;even on
      women and children kneeling in the act of prayer; the priests were tracked
      night and day from one hiding-place, where they still offered up worship,
      to another, and were killed as soon as overtaken&mdash;every atrocity was
      committed in every district; but the Christian religion still spread wider
      than the widest bloodshed; still sprang up with ever-renewed vitality from
      under the very feet of the men whose vain fury was powerless to trample it
      down. Everywhere the people remained true to their Faith; everywhere the
      priests stood firm by them in their sorest need. The executioners of the
      Republic had been sent to make Brittany a country of apostates; they did
      their worst, and left it a country of martyrs.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, while this frightful persecution was still raging, Gabriel
      happened to be detained unusually late at the cottage of Perrine&rsquo;s father.
      He had lately spent much of his time at the farm house; it was his only
      refuge now from that place of suffering, of silence, and of secret shame,
      which he had once called home! Just as he had taken leave of Perrine for
      the night, and was about to open the farmhouse door, her father stopped
      him, and pointed to a chair in the chimney-corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave us alone, my dear,&rdquo; said the old man to his daughter; &ldquo;I want to
      speak to Gabriel. You can go to your mother in the next room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words which Pere Bonan&mdash;as he was called by the neighbors&mdash;had
      now to say in private were destined to lead to very unexpected events.
      After referring to the alteration which had appeared of late in Gabriel&rsquo;s
      manner, the old man began by asking him, sorrowfully but not suspiciously,
      whether he still preserved his old affection for Perrine. On receiving an
      eager answer in the affirmative, Pere Bonan then referred to the
      persecution still raging through the country, and to the consequent
      possibility that he, like others of his countrymen, might yet be called to
      suffer, and perhaps to die, for the cause of his religion. If this last
      act of self-sacrifice were required of him, Perrine would be left
      unprotected, unless her affianced husband performed his promise to her,
      and assumed, without delay, the position of her lawful guardian. &ldquo;Let me
      know that you will do this,&rdquo; concluded the old man; &ldquo;I shall be resigned
      to all that may be required of me, if I can only know that I shall not die
      leaving Perrine unprotected.&rdquo; Gabriel gave the promise&mdash;gave it with
      his whole heart. As he took leave of Pere Bonan, the old man said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here to-morrow; I shall know more then than I know now&mdash;I shall
      be able to fix with certainty the day for the fulfillment of your
      engagement with Perrine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why did Gabriel hesitate at the farmhouse door, looking back on Pere Bonan
      as though he would fain say something, and yet not speaking a word? Why,
      after he had gone out and had walked onward several paces, did he suddenly
      stop, return quickly to the farmhouse, stand irresolute before the gate,
      and then retrace his steps, sighing heavily as he went, but never pausing
      again on his homeward way? Because the torment of his horrible secret had
      grown harder to bear than ever, since he had given the promise that had
      been required of him. Because, while a strong impulse moved him frankly to
      lay bare his hidden dread and doubt to the father whose beloved daughter
      was soon to be his wife, there was a yet stronger passive influence which
      paralyzed on his lips the terrible confession that he knew not whether he
      was the son of an honest man, or the son of an assassin, and a robber.
      Made desperate by his situation, he determined, while he hastened
      homeward, to risk the worst, and ask that fatal question of his father in
      plain words. But this supreme trial for parent and child was not to be.
      When he entered the cottage, Francois was absent. He had told the younger
      children that he should not be home again before noon on the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning Gabriel repaired to the farmhouse, as he had been
      bidden. Influenced, by his love for Perrine, blindly confiding in the
      faint hope (which, in despite of heart and conscience, he still forced
      himself to cherish) that his father might be innocent, he now preserved
      the appearance at least of perfect calmness. &ldquo;If I tell my secret to
      Perrine&rsquo;s father, I risk disturbing in him that confidence in the future
      safety of his child for which I am his present and only warrant.&rdquo;
       Something like this thought was in Gabriel&rsquo;s mind, as he took the hand of
      Pere Bonan, and waited anxiously to hear what was required of him on that
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a short respite from danger, Gabriel,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;News
      has come to me that the spoilers of our churches and the murderers of our
      congregations have been stopped on their way hitherward by tidings which
      have reached them from another district. This interval of peace and safety
      will be a short one&mdash;we must take advantage of it while it is yet
      ours. My name is among the names on the list of the denounced. If the
      soldiers of the Republic find me here&mdash;but we will say nothing more
      of this; it is of Perrine and of you that I must now speak. On this very
      evening your marriage may be solemnized with all the wonted rites of our
      holy religion, and the blessing may be pronounced over you by the lips of
      a priest. This evening, therefore, Gabriel, you must become the husband
      and the protector of Perrine. Listen to me attentively, and I will tell
      you how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the substance of what Gabriel now heard from Pere Bonan:
    </p>
    <p>
      Not very long before the persecutions broke out in Brittany, a priest,
      known generally by the name of Father Paul, was appointed to a curacy in
      one of the northern districts of the province. He fulfilled all the duties
      of his station in such a manner as to win the confidence and affection of
      every member of his congregation, and was often spoken of with respect,
      even in parts of the country distant from the scene of his labors. It was
      not, however, until the troubles broke out, and the destruction and
      bloodshed began, that he became renowned far and wide, from one end of
      Brittany to another. From the date of the very first persecutions the name
      of Father Paul was a rallying-cry of the hunted peasantry; he was their
      great encouragement under oppression, their example in danger, their last
      and only consoler in the hour of death. Wherever havoc and ruin raged most
      fiercely, wherever the pursuit was hottest and the slaughter most cruel,
      there the intrepid priest was sure to be seen pursuing his sacred duties
      in defiance of every peril. His hair-breadth escapes from death; his
      extraordinary re-appearances in parts of the country where no one ever
      expected to see him again, were regarded by the poorer classes with
      superstitious awe. Wherever Father Paul appeared, with his black dress,
      his calm face, and the ivory crucifix which he always carried in his hand,
      the people reverenced him as more than mortal; and grew at last to
      believe, that, single-handed, he would successfully defend his religion
      against the armies of the Republic. But their simple confidence in his
      powers of resistance was soon destined to be shaken. Fresh re-enforcements
      arrived in Brittany, and overran the whole province from one end to the
      other. One morning, after celebrating service in a dismantled church, and
      after narrowly escaping with his life from those who pursued him, the
      priest disappeared. Secret inquiries were made after him in all
      directions; but he was heard of no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many weary days had passed, and the dispirited peasantry had already
      mourned him as dead, when some fishermen on the northern coast observed a
      ship of light burden in the offing, making signals to the shore. They put
      off to her in their boats; and on reaching the deck saw standing before
      them the well-remembered figure of Father Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest had returned to his congregations, and had founded the new
      altar that they were to worship at on the deck of the ship! Razed from the
      face of the earth, their church had not been destroyed&mdash;for Father
      Paul and the priests who acted with him had given that church a refuge on
      the sea. Henceforth, their children could still be baptized, their sons
      and daughters could still be married, the burial of their dead could still
      be solemnized, under the sanction of the old religion for which, not
      vainly, they had suffered so patiently and so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the remaining time of trouble the services were uninterrupted
      on board the ship. A code of signals was established by which those on
      shore were always enabled to direct their brethren at sea toward such
      parts of the coast as happened to be uninfested by the enemies of their
      worship. On the morning of Gabriel&rsquo;s visit to the farmhouse these signals
      had shaped the course of the ship toward the extremity of the peninsula of
      Quiberon. The people of the district were all prepared to expect the
      appearance of the vessel some time in the evening, and had their boats
      ready at a moment&rsquo;s notice to put off, and attend the service. At the
      conclusion of this service Pere Bonan had arranged that the marriage of
      his daughter and Gabriel was to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited for evening at the farmhouse. A little before sunset the ship
      was signaled as in sight; and then Pere Bonan and his wife, followed by
      Gabriel and Perrine, set forth over the heath to the beach. With the
      solitary exception of Francois Sarzeau, the whole population of the
      neighborhood was already assembled there, Gabriel&rsquo;s brother and sisters
      being among the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the calmest evening that had been known for months. There was not a
      cloud in the lustrous sky&mdash;not a ripple on the still surface of the
      sea. The smallest children were suffered by their mothers to stray down on
      the beach as they pleased; for the waves of the great ocean slept as
      tenderly and noiselessly on their sandy bed as if they had been changed
      into the waters of an inland lake. Slow, almost imperceptible, was the
      approach of the ship&mdash;there was hardly a breath of wind to carry her
      on&mdash;she was just drifting gently with the landward set of the tide at
      that hour, while her sails hung idly against the masts. Long after the sun
      had gone down, the congregation still waited and watched on the beach. The
      moon and stars were arrayed in their glory of the night before the ship
      dropped anchor. Then the muffled tolling of a bell came solemnly across
      the quiet waters; and then, from every creek along the shore, as far as
      the eye could reach, the black forms of the fishermen&rsquo;s boats shot out
      swift and stealthy into the shining sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the boats had arrived alongside of the ship, the lamp had been
      kindled before the altar, and its flame was gleaming red and dull in the
      radiant moonlight. Two of the priests on board were clothed in their robes
      of office, and were waiting in their appointed places to begin the
      service. But there was a third, dressed only in the ordinary attire of his
      calling, who mingled with the congregation, and spoke a few words to each
      of the persons composing it, as, one by one, they mounted the sides of the
      ship. Those who had never seen him before knew by the famous ivory
      crucifix in his hand that the priest who received them was Father Paul.
      Gabriel looked at this man, whom he now beheld for the first time, with a
      mixture of astonishment and awe; for he saw that the renowned chief of the
      Christians of Brittany was, to all appearance, but little older than
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression on the pale, calm face of the priest was so gentle and
      kind, that children just able to walk tottered up to him, and held
      familiarly by the skirts of his black gown, whenever his clear blue eyes
      rested on theirs, while he beckoned them to his side. No one would ever
      have guessed from the countenance of Father Paul what deadly perils he had
      confronted, but for the scar of a saber-wound, as yet hardly healed, which
      ran across his forehead. That wound had been dealt while he was kneeling
      before the altar in the last church in Brittany which had escaped
      spoliation. He would have died where he knelt, but for the peasants who
      were praying with him, and who, unarmed as they were, threw themselves
      like tigers on the soldiery, and at awful sacrifice of their own lives
      saved the life of their priest. There was not a man now on board the ship
      who would have hesitated, had the occasion called for it again, to have
      rescued him in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service began. Since the days when the primitive Christians worshiped
      amid the caverns of the earth, can any service be imagined nobler in
      itself, or sublimer in the circumstances surrounding it, than that which
      was now offered up? Here was no artificial pomp, no gaudy profusion of
      ornament, no attendant grandeur of man&rsquo;s creation. All around this church
      spread the hushed and awful majesty of the tranquil sea. The roof of this
      cathedral was the immeasurable heaven, the pure moon its one great light,
      the countless glories of the stars its only adornment. Here were no hired
      singers or rich priest-princes; no curious sight-seers, or careless lovers
      of sweet sounds. This congregation and they who had gathered it together,
      were all poor alike, all persecuted alike, all worshiping alike, to the
      overthrow of their worldly interests, and at the imminent peril of their
      lives. How brightly and tenderly the moonlight shone upon the altar and
      the people before it! how solemnly and divinely the deep harmonies, as
      they chanted the penitential Psalms, mingled with the hoarse singing of
      the freshening night breeze in the rigging of the ship! how sweetly the
      still rushing murmur of many voices, as they uttered the responses
      together, now died away, and now rose again softly into the mysterious
      night!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the members of the congregation&mdash;young or old&mdash;there was
      but one over whom that impressive service exercised no influence of
      consolation or of peace; that one was Gabriel. Often, throughout the day,
      his reproaching conscience had spoken within him again and again. Often
      when he joined the little assembly on the beach, he turned away his face
      in secret shame and apprehension from Perrine and her father. Vainly,
      after gaining the deck of the ship, did he try to meet the eye of Father
      Paul as frankly, as readily, and as affectionately as others met it. The
      burden of concealment seemed too heavy to be borne in the presence of the
      priest&mdash;and yet, torment as it was, he still bore it! But when he
      knelt with the rest of the congregation and saw Perrine kneeling by his
      side&mdash;when he felt the calmness of the solemn night and the still sea
      filling his heart&mdash;when the sounds of the first prayers spoke with a
      dread spiritual language of their own to his soul&mdash;then the
      remembrance of the confession which he had neglected, and the terror of
      receiving unprepared the sacrament which he knew would be offered to him&mdash;grew
      too vivid to be endured; the sense that he merited no longer, though once
      worthy of it, the confidence in his perfect truth and candor placed in him
      by the woman with whom he was soon to stand before the altar, overwhelmed
      him with shame: the mere act of kneeling among that congregation, the
      passive accomplice by his silence and secrecy, for aught he knew to the
      contrary, of a crime which it was his bounden duty to denounce, appalled
      him as if he had already committed sacrilege that could never be forgiven.
      Tears flowed down his cheeks, though he strove to repress them: sobs burst
      from him, though he tried to stifle them. He knew that others besides
      Perrine were looking at him in astonishment and alarm; but he could
      neither control himself, nor move to leave his place, nor raise his eyes
      even&mdash;until suddenly he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. That touch,
      slight as it was, ran through him instantly. He looked up, and saw Father
      Paul standing by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beckoning him to follow, and signing to the congregation not to suspend
      their devotions, he led Gabriel out of the assembly&mdash;then paused for
      a moment, reflecting&mdash;then beckoning him again, took him into the
      cabin of the ship, and closed the door carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have something on your mind,&rdquo; he said, simply and quietly, taking the
      young man by the hand. &ldquo;I may be able to relieve you, if you tell me what
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Gabriel heard these gentle words, and saw, by the light of a lamp which
      burned before a cross fixed against the wall, the sad kindness of
      expression with which the priest was regarding him, the oppression that
      had lain so long on his heart seemed to leave it in an instant. The
      haunting fear of ever divulging his fatal suspicions and his fatal secret
      had vanished, as it were, at the touch of Father Paul&rsquo;s hand. For the
      first time he now repeated to another ear&mdash;the sounds of prayer and
      praise rising grandly the while from the congregation above&mdash;his
      grandfather&rsquo;s death-bed confession, word for word almost, as he had heard
      it in the cottage on the night of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, and once only, did Father Paul interrupt the narrative, which in
      whispers was addressed to him. Gabriel had hardly repeated the first two
      or three sentences of his grandfather&rsquo;s confession, when the priest, in
      quick, altered tones, abruptly asked him his name and place of abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the question was answered, Father Paul&rsquo;s calm face became suddenly
      agitated; but the next moment, resolutely resuming his self-possession, he
      bowed his head as a sign that Gabriel was to continue; clasped his
      trembling hands, and raising them as if in silent prayer, fixed his eyes
      intently on the cross. He never looked away from it while the terrible
      narrative proceeded. But when Gabriel described his search at the
      Merchant&rsquo;s Table; and, referring to his father&rsquo;s behavior since that time,
      appealed to the priest to know whether he might even yet, in defiance of
      appearances, be still filially justified in doubting whether the crime had
      been really perpetrated&mdash;then Father Paul moved near to him once
      more, and spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compose yourself, and look at me,&rdquo; he said, with his former sad kindness
      of voice and manner. &ldquo;I can end your doubts forever. Gabriel, your father
      was guilty in intention and in act; but the victim of his crime still
      lives. I can prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel&rsquo;s heart beat wildly; a deadly coldness crept over him as he saw
      Father Paul loosen the fastening of his cassock round the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant the chanting of the congregation above ceased; and then
      the sudden and awful stillness was deepened rather than interrupted by the
      faint sound of one voice praying. Slowly and with trembling fingers the
      priest removed the band round his neck&mdash;paused a little&mdash;sighed
      heavily&mdash;and pointed to a scar which was now plainly visible on one
      side of his throat. He said something at the same time; but the bell above
      tolled while he spoke. It was the signal of the elevation of the Host.
      Gabriel felt an arm passed round him, guiding him to his knees, and
      sustaining him from sinking to the floor. For one moment longer he was
      conscious that the bell had stopped, that there was dead silence, that
      Father Paul was kneeling by him beneath the cross, with bowed head&mdash;then
      all objects around vanished; and he saw and knew nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he recovered his senses, he was still in the cabin; the man whose
      life his father had attempted was bending over him, and sprinkling water
      on his face; and the clear voices of the women and children of the
      congregation were joining the voices of the men in singing the <i>Agnus
      Dei.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look up at me without fear, Gabriel,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;I desire not to
      avenge injuries: I visit not the sins of the father on the child. Look up,
      and listen! I have strange things to speak of; and I have a sacred mission
      to fulfill before the morning, in which you must be my guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel attempted to kneel and kiss his hand but Father Paul stopped him,
      and said, pointing to the cross: &ldquo;Kneel to that&mdash;not to me; not to
      your fellow-mortal, and your friend&mdash;for I will be your friend,
      Gabriel; believing that God&rsquo;s mercy has ordered it so. And now listen to
      me,&rdquo; he proceeded, with a brotherly tenderness in his manner which went to
      Gabriel&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;The service is nearly ended. What I have to tell you
      must be told at once; the errand on which you will guide me must be
      performed before to-morrow dawns. Sit here near me, and attend to what I
      now say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel obeyed; Father Paul then proceeded thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe the confession made to you by your grandfather to have been
      true in every particular. On the evening to which he referred you, I
      approached your cottage, as he said, for the purpose of asking shelter for
      the night. At that period I had been studying hard to qualify myself for
      the holy calling which I now pursue; and, on the completion of my studies,
      had indulged in the recreation of a tour on foot through Brittany, by way
      of innocently and agreeably occupying the leisure time then at my
      disposal, before I entered the priesthood. When I accosted your father I
      had lost my way, had been walking for many hours, and was glad of any rest
      that I could get for the night. It is unnecessary to pain you now, by
      reference to the events which followed my entrance under your father&rsquo;s
      roof. I remember nothing that happened from the time when I lay down to
      sleep before the fire, until the time when I recovered my senses at the
      place which you call the Merchant&rsquo;s Table. My first sensation was that of
      being moved into the cold air; when I opened my eyes I saw the great Druid
      stones rising close above me, and two men on either side of me rifling my
      pockets. They found nothing valuable there, and were about to leave me
      where I lay, when I gathered strength enough to appeal to their mercy
      through their cupidity. Money was not scarce with me then, and I was able
      to offer them a rich reward (which they ultimately received as I had
      promised) if they would take me to any place where I could get shelter and
      medical help. I supposed they inferred by my language and accent&mdash;perhaps
      also by the linen I wore, which they examined closely&mdash;that I
      belonged to the higher ranks of the community, in spite of the plainness
      of my outer garments; and might, therefore, be in a position to make good
      my promise to them. I heard one say to the other, &lsquo;Let us risk it&rsquo;; and
      then they took me in their arms, carried me down to a boat on the beach,
      and rowed to a vessel in the offing. The next day they disembarked me at
      Paimboeuf, where I got the assistance which I so much needed. I learned,
      through the confidence they were obliged to place in me in order to give
      me the means of sending them their promised reward, that these men were
      smugglers, and that they were in the habit of using the cavity in which I
      had been laid as a place of concealment for goods, and for letters of
      advice to their accomplices. This accounted for their finding me. As to my
      wound, I was informed by the surgeon who attended me that it had missed
      being inflicted in a mortal part by less than a quarter of an inch, and
      that, as it was, nothing but the action of the night air in coagulating
      the blood over the place, had, in the first instance, saved my life. To be
      brief, I recovered after a long illness, returned to Paris, and was called
      to the priesthood. The will of my superiors obliged me to perform the
      first duties of my vocation in the great city; but my own wish was to be
      appointed to a cure of souls in your province, Gabriel. Can you imagine
      why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer to this question was in Gabriel&rsquo;s heart; but he was still too
      deeply awed and affected by what he had heard to give it utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you, then, what my motive was,&rdquo; said Father Paul. &ldquo;You must
      know first that I uniformly abstained from disclosing to any one where and
      by whom my life had been attempted. I kept this a secret from the men who
      rescued me&mdash;from the surgeon&mdash;from my own friends even. My
      reason for such a proceeding was, I would fain believe, a Christian
      reason. I hope I had always felt a sincere and humble desire to prove
      myself, by the help of God, worthy of the sacred vocation to which I was
      destined. But my miraculous escape from death made an impression on my
      mind, which gave me another and an infinitely higher view of this vocation&mdash;the
      view which I have since striven, and shall always strive for the future,
      to maintain. As I lay, during the first days of my recovery, examining my
      own heart, and considering in what manner it would be my duty to act
      toward your father when I was restored to health, a thought came into my
      mind which calmed, comforted, and resolved all my doubts. I said within
      myself, &lsquo;In a few months more I shall be called to be one of the chosen
      ministers of God. If I am worthy of my vocation, my first desire toward
      this man who has attempted to take my life should be, not to know that
      human justice has overtaken him, but to know that he has truly and
      religiously repented and made atonement for his guilt. To such repentance
      and atonement let it be my duty to call him; if he reject that appeal, and
      be hardened only the more against me because I have forgiven him my
      injuries, then it will be time enough to denounce him for his crimes to
      his fellow-men. Surely it must be well for me, here and hereafter, if I
      begin my career in the holy priesthood by helping to save from hell the
      soul of the man who, of all others, has most cruelly wronged me.&rsquo; It was
      for this reason, Gabriel&mdash;it was because I desired to go straightway
      to your father&rsquo;s cottage, and reclaim him after he had believed me to be
      dead&mdash;that I kept the secret and entreated of my superiors that I
      might be sent to Brittany. But this, as I have said, was not to be at
      first, and when my desire was granted, my place was assigned me in a far
      district. The persecution under which we still suffer broke out; the
      designs of my life were changed; my own will became no longer mine to
      guide me. But, through sorrow and suffering, and danger and bloodshed, I
      am now led, after many days, to the execution of that first purpose which
      I formed on entering the priesthood. Gabriel, when the service is over,
      and the congregation are dispersed, you must guide me to the door of your
      father&rsquo;s cottage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his hand, in sign of silence, as Gabriel was about to answer.
      Just then the officiating priests above were pronouncing the final
      benediction. When it was over, Father Paul opened the cabin door. As he
      ascended the steps, followed by Gabriel, Pere Bonan met them. The old man
      looked doubtfully and searchingly on his future son-in-law, as he
      respectfully whispered a few words in the ear of the priest. Father Paul
      listened attentively, answered in a whisper, and then turned to Gabriel,
      first begging the few people near them to withdraw a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been asked whether there is any impediment to your marriage,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and have answered that there is none. What you have said to me has
      been said in confession, and is a secret between us two. Remember that;
      and forget not, at the same time, the service which I shall require of you
      to-night, after the marriage-ceremony is over. Where is Perrine Bonan?&rdquo; he
      added, aloud, looking round him. Perrine came forward. Father Paul took
      her hand and placed it in Gabriel&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Lead her to the altar steps,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and wait there for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was more than an hour later; the boats had left the ship&rsquo;s side; the
      congregation had dispersed over the face of the country&mdash;but still
      the vessel remained at anchor. Those who were left in her watched the land
      more anxiously than usual; for they knew that Father Paul had risked
      meeting the soldiers of the Republic by trusting himself on shore. A boat
      was awaiting his return on the beach; half of the crew, armed, being
      posted as scouts in various directions on the high land of the heath. They
      would have followed and guarded the priest to the place of his
      destination; but he forbade it; and, leaving them abruptly, walked swiftly
      onward with one young man only for his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel had committed his brother and his sisters to the charge of
      Perrine. They were to go to the farmhouse that night with his
      newly-married wife and her father and mother. Father Paul had desired that
      this might be done. When Gabriel and he were left alone to follow the path
      which led to the fisherman&rsquo;s cottage, the priest never spoke while they
      walked on&mdash;never looked aside either to the right or the left&mdash;always
      held his ivory crucifix clasped to his breast. They arrived at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knock,&rdquo; whispered Father Paul to Gabriel, &ldquo;and then wait here with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened. On a lovely moonlight night Francois Sarzeau had
      stood on that threshold, years since, with a bleeding body in his arms. On
      a lovely moonlight night he now stood there again, confronting the very
      man whose life he had attempted, and knowing him not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Paul advanced a few paces, so that the moonlight fell fuller on his
      features, and removed his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francois Sarzeau looked, started, moved one step back, then stood
      motionless and perfectly silent, while all traces of expression of any
      kind suddenly vanished from his face. Then the calm, clear tones of the
      priest stole gently on the dead silence. &ldquo;I bring a message of peace and
      forgiveness from a guest of former years,&rdquo; he said; and pointed, as he
      spoke, to the place where he had been wounded in the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one moment, Gabriel saw his father trembling violently from head to
      foot&mdash;then his limbs steadied again&mdash;stiffened suddenly, as if
      struck by catalepsy. His lips parted, but without quivering; his eyes
      glared, but without moving in the orbits. The lovely moonlight itself
      looked ghastly and horrible, shining on the supernatural panic deformity
      of that face! Gabriel turned away his head in terror. He heard the voice
      of Father Paul saying to him: &ldquo;Wait here till I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was an instant of silence again&mdash;then a low groaning sound
      that seemed to articulate the name of God; a sound unlike his father&rsquo;s
      voice, unlike any human voice he had ever heard&mdash;and then the noise
      of a closing door. He looked up, and saw that he was standing alone before
      the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, after an interval, he approached the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He just saw through it the hand of the priest holding on high the ivory
      crucifix; but stopped not to see more, for he heard such words, such
      sounds, as drove him back to his former place. There he stayed, until the
      noise of something falling heavily within the cottage struck on his ear.
      Again he advanced toward the door; heard Father Paul praying; listened for
      several minutes; then heard a moaning voice, now joining itself to the
      voice of the priest, now choked in sobs and bitter wailing. Once more he
      went back out of hearing, and stirred not again from his place. He waited
      a long and a weary time there&mdash;so long that one of the scouts on the
      lookout came toward him, evidently suspicious of the delay in the priest&rsquo;s
      return. He waved the man back, and then looked again toward the door. At
      last he saw it open&mdash;saw Father Paul approach him, leading Francois
      Sarzeau by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman never raised his downcast eyes to his son&rsquo;s face; tears
      trickled silently over his cheeks; he followed the hand that led him, as a
      little child might have followed it, listened anxiously and humbly at the
      priest&rsquo;s side to every word that he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel,&rdquo; said Father Paul, in a voice which trembled a little for the
      first time that night&mdash;&ldquo;Gabriel, it has pleased God to grant the
      perfect fulfillment of the purpose which brought me to this place; I tell
      you this, as all that you need&mdash;as all, I believe, that you would
      wish&mdash;to know of what has passed while you have been left waiting for
      me here. Such words as I have now to speak to you are spoken by your
      father&rsquo;s earnest desire. It is his own wish that I should communicate to
      you his confession of having secretly followed you to the Merchant&rsquo;s
      Table, and of having discovered (as you discovered) that no evidence of
      his guilt remained there. This admission, he thinks, will be enough to
      account for his conduct toward yourself from that time to this. I have
      next to tell you (also at your father&rsquo;s desire) that he has promised in my
      presence, and now promises again in yours, sincerity of repentance in this
      manner: When the persecution of our religion has ceased&mdash;as cease it
      will, and that speedily, be assured of it&mdash;he solemnly pledges
      himself henceforth to devote his life, his strength and what worldly
      possessions he may have, or may acquire, to the task of re-erecting and
      restoring the road-side crosses which have been sacrilegiously overthrown
      and destroyed in his native province, and to doing good, go where he may.
      I have now said all that is required of me, and may bid you farewell&mdash;bearing
      with me the happy remembrance that I have left a father and son reconciled
      and restored to each other. May God bless and prosper you, and those dear
      to you, Gabriel! May God accept your father&rsquo;s repentance, and bless him
      also throughout his future life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took their hands, pressed them long and warmly, then turned and walked
      quickly down the path which led to the beach. Gabriel dared not trust
      himself yet to speak; but he raised his arm, and put it gently round his
      father&rsquo;s neck. The two stood together so, looking out dimly through the
      tears that filled their eyes to the sea. They saw the boat put off in the
      bright track of the moonlight, and reach the vessel&rsquo;s side; they watched
      the spreading of the sails, and followed the slow course of the ship till
      she disappeared past a distant headland from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, they went into the cottage together. They knew it not then,
      but they had seen the last, in this world, of Father Paul.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The events foretold by the good priest happened sooner even than he had
      anticipated. A new government ruled the destinies of France, and the
      persecution ceased in Brittany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other propositions which were then submitted to the Parliament, was
      one advocating the restoration of the road-side crosses throughout the
      province. It was found, however, on inquiry, that these crosses were to be
      counted by thousands, and that the mere cost of wood required to re-erect
      them necessitated an expenditure of money which the bankrupt nation could
      ill afford to spare. While this project was under discussion, and before
      it was finally rejected, one man had undertaken the task which the
      Government shrank from attempting. When Gabriel left the cottage, taking
      his brother and sisters to live with his wife and himself at the
      farmhouse, Francois Sarzeau left it also, to perform in highway and byway
      his promise to Father Paul. For months and months he labored without
      intermission at his task; still, always doing good, and rendering help and
      kindness and true charity to any whom he could serve. He walked many a
      weary mile, toiled through many a hard day&rsquo;s work, humbled himself even to
      beg of others, to get wood enough to restore a single cross. No one ever
      heard him complain, ever saw him impatient, ever detected him in faltering
      at his task. The shelter in an outhouse, the crust of bread and drink of
      water, which he could always get from the peasantry, seemed to suffice
      him. Among the people who watched his perseverance, a belief began to gain
      ground that his life would be miraculously prolonged until he had
      completed his undertaking from one end of Brittany to the other. But this
      was not to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was seen one cold autumn evening, silently and steadily at work as
      usual, setting up a new cross on the site of one which had been shattered
      to splinters in the troubled times. In the morning he was found lying dead
      beneath the sacred symbol which his own hands had completed and erected in
      its place during the night. They buried him where he lay; and the priest
      who consecrated the ground allowed Gabriel to engrave his father&rsquo;s epitaph
      in the wood of the cross. It was simply the initial letters of the dead
      man&rsquo;s name, followed by this inscription: &ldquo;Pray for the repose of his
      soul: he died penitent, and the doer of good works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once, and once only, did Gabriel hear anything of Father Paul. The good
      priest showed, by writing to the farmhouse, that he had not forgotten the
      family so largely indebted to him for their happiness. The letter was
      dated &ldquo;Rome.&rdquo; Father Paul said that such services as he had been permitted
      to render to the Church in Brittany had obtained for him a new and a far
      more glorious trust than any he had yet held. He had been recalled from
      his curacy, and appointed to be at the head of a mission which was shortly
      to be dispatched to convert the inhabitants of a savage and far distant
      land to the Christian faith. He now wrote, as his brethren with him were
      writing, to take leave of all friends forever in this world, before
      setting out&mdash;for it was well known to the chosen persons intrusted
      with the new mission that they could only hope to advance its object by
      cheerfully risking their own lives for the sake of their religion. He gave
      his blessing to Francois Sarzeau, to Gabriel, and to his family; and bade
      them affectionately farewell for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a postscript to the letter, which was addressed to Perrine, and
      which she often read afterward with tearful eyes. The writer begged that,
      if she should have any children, she would show her friendly and Christian
      remembrance of him by teaching them to pray (as he hoped she herself would
      pray) that a blessing might attend Father Paul&rsquo;s labors in the distant
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest&rsquo;s loving petition was never forgotten. When Perrine taught its
      first prayer to her first child, the little creature was instructed to end
      the few simple words pronounced at its mother&rsquo;s knees, with, &ldquo;God bless
      Father Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In those words the nun concluded her narrative. After it was ended, she
      pointed to the old wooden cross, and said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was one of the many that he made. It was found, a few years since,
      to have suffered so much from exposure to the weather that it was unfit to
      remain any longer in its old place. A priest in Brittany gave it to one of
      the nuns in this convent. Do you wonder now that the Mother Superior
      always calls it a Relic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And I should have small respect indeed for the
      religious convictions of any one who could hear the story of that wooden
      cross, and not feel that the Mother Superior&rsquo;s name for it is the very
      best that could have been chosen.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      PROLOGUE TO THE SIXTH STORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the last occasion when I made a lengthened stay in London, my wife and
      I were surprised and amused one morning by the receipt of the following
      note, addressed to me in a small, crabbed, foreign-looking handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Tizzi presents amiable compliments to Mr. Kerby, the artist,
      and is desirous of having his portrait done, to be engraved from, and
      placed at the beginning of the voluminous work on &lsquo;The Vital Principle;
      or, Invisible Essence of Life,&rsquo; which the Professor is now preparing for
      the press&mdash;and posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Professor will give five pounds; and will look upon his face with
      satisfaction, as an object perpetuated for public contemplation at a
      reasonable rate, if Mr. Kerby will accept the sum just mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In regard to the Professor&rsquo;s ability to pay five pounds, as well as to
      offer them, if Mr. Kerby should, from ignorance, entertain injurious
      doubts, he is requested to apply to the Professor&rsquo;s honorable friend, Mr.
      Lanfray, of Rockleigh Place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for the reference at the end of this strange note, I should certainly
      have considered it as a mere trap set to make a fool of me by some
      mischievous friend. As it was, I rather doubted the propriety of taking
      any serious notice of Professor Tizzi&rsquo;s offer; and I might probably have
      ended by putting the letter in the fire without further thought about it,
      but for the arrival by the next post of a note from Mr. Lanfray, which
      solved all my doubts, and sent me away at once to make the acquaintance of
      the learned discoverer of the Essence of Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be surprised&rdquo; (Mr. Lanfray wrote) &ldquo;if you get a strange note from
      a very eccentric Italian, one Professor Tizzi, formerly of the University
      of Padua. I have known him for some years. Scientific inquiry is his
      monomania, and vanity his ruling passion. He has written a book on the
      principle of life, which nobody but himself will ever read; but which he
      is determined to publish, with his own portrait for frontispiece. If it is
      worth your while to accept the little he can offer you, take it by all
      means, for he is a character worth knowing. He was exiled, I should tell
      you, years ago, for some absurd political reason, and has lived in England
      ever since. All the money he inherits from his father, who was a mail
      contractor in the north of Italy, goes in books and experiments; but I
      think I can answer for his solvency, at any rate, for the large sum of
      five pounds. If you are not very much occupied just now, go and see him.
      He is sure to amuse you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Professor Tizzi lived in the northern suburb of London. On approaching his
      house, I found it, so far as outward appearance went, excessively dirty
      and neglected, but in no other respect different from the &ldquo;villas&rdquo; in its
      neighborhood. The front garden door, after I had rang twice, was opened by
      a yellow-faced, suspicious old foreigner, dressed in worn-out clothes, and
      completely and consistently dirty all over, from top to toe. On mentioning
      my name and business, this old man led me across a weedy, neglected
      garden, and admitted me into the house. At the first step into the
      passage, I was surrounded by books. Closely packed in plain wooden
      shelves, they ran all along the wall on either side to the back of the
      house; and when I looked up at the carpetless staircase, I saw nothing but
      books again, running all the way up the wall, as far as my eye could
      reach. &ldquo;Here is the Artist Painter!&rdquo; cried the old servant, throwing open
      one of the parlor doors, before I had half done looking at the books, and
      signing impatiently to me to walk into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Books again! all round the walls, and all over the floor&mdash;among them
      a plain deal table, with leaves of manuscript piled high on every part of
      it&mdash;among the leaves a head of long, elfish white hair covered with a
      black skull-cap, and bent down over a book&mdash;above the head a sallow,
      withered hand shaking itself at me as a sign that I must not venture to
      speak just at that moment&mdash;on the tops of the bookcases glass vases
      full of spirits of some kind, with horrible objects floating in the liquid&mdash;dirt
      on the window panes, cobwebs hanging from the ceiling, dust springing up
      in clouds under my intruding feet. These were the things I observed on
      first entering the study of Professor Tizzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had waited for a minute or so, the shaking hand stopped, descended
      with a smack on the nearest pile of manuscript, seized the book that the
      head had been bending over, and flung it contemptuously to the other end
      of the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve refuted <i>you,</i> at any rate!&rdquo; said Professor Tizzi,
      looking with extreme complacency at the cloud of dust raised by the fall
      of the rejected volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned next to me. What a grand face it was! What a broad, white
      forehead&mdash;-what fiercely brilliant black eyes&mdash;what perfect
      regularity and refinement in the other features; with the long, venerable
      hair, framing them in, as it were, on either side! Poor as I was, I felt
      that I could have painted his portrait for nothing. Titian, Vandyke,
      Valasquez&mdash;any of the three would have paid him to sit to them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept my humblest excuses, sir,&rdquo; said the old man, speaking English with
      a singularly pure accent for a foreigner. &ldquo;That absurd book plunged me so
      deep down in the quagmires of sophistry and error, Mr. Kerby, that I
      really could not get to the surface at once when you came into the room.
      So you are willing to draw my likeness for such a small sum as five
      pounds?&rdquo; he continued, rising, and showing me that he wore a long black
      velvet gown, instead of the paltry and senseless costume of modern times.
    </p>
    <p>
      I informed him that five pounds was as much as I generally got for a
      drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems little,&rdquo; said the professor; &ldquo;but if you want fame, I can make
      it up to you in that way. There is my great work&rdquo; (he pointed to the piles
      of manuscript), &ldquo;the portrait of my mind and the mirror of my learning;
      put a likeness of my face on the first page, and posterity will then be
      thoroughly acquainted with me, outside and in. Your portrait will be
      engraved, Mr. Kerby, and your name shall be inscribed under the print. You
      shall be associated, sir, in that way, with a work which will form an
      epoch in the history of human science. The Vital Principle&mdash;or, in
      other words, the essence of that mysterious Something which we call Life,
      and which extends down from Man to the feeblest insect and the smallest
      plant&mdash;has been an unguessed riddle from the beginning of the world
      to the present time. I alone have found the answer; and here it is!&rdquo; He
      fixed his dazzling eyes on me in triumph, and smacked the piles of
      manuscript fiercely with both his sallow hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that he was waiting for me to say something; so I asked if his great
      work had not cost a vast expenditure of time and pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am seventy, sir,&rdquo; said the Professor; &ldquo;and I began preparing myself for
      that book at twenty. After mature consideration, I have written it in
      English (having three other foreign languages at my fingers&rsquo; ends), as a
      substantial proof of my gratitude to the nation that has given me an
      asylum. Perhaps you think the work looks rather long in its manuscript
      state? It will occupy twelve volumes, sir, and it is not half long enough,
      even then, for the subject. I take two volumes (and no man could do it in
      less) to examine the theories of all the philosophers in the world,
      ancient and modern, on the Vital Principle. I take two more (and little
      enough) to scatter every one of the theories, <i>seriatim</i>, to the
      winds. I take two more (at the risk, for brevity&rsquo;s sake, of doing things
      by halves) to explain the exact stuff, or vital compound, of which the
      first man and woman in the world were made&mdash;calling them Adam and
      Eve, out of deference to popular prejudices. I take two more&mdash;but you
      are standing all this time, Mr. Kerby; and I am talking instead of sitting
      for my portrait. Pray take any books you want, anywhere off the floor, and
      make a seat of any height you please. Furniture would only be in my way
      here, so I don&rsquo;t trouble myself with anything of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I obediently followed the Professor&rsquo;s directions, and had just heaped up a
      pile of grimy quartos, when the old servant entered the room with a shabby
      little tray in his hand. In the middle of the tray I saw a crust of bread
      and a bit of garlic, encircled by a glass of water, a knife, salt, pepper,
      a bottle of vinegar, and a flask of oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your permission, I am going to breakfast,&rdquo; said Professor Tizzi, as
      the tray was set down before him on the part of his great work relating to
      the vital compound of Adam and Eve. As he spoke, he took up the piece of
      bread, and rubbed the crusty part of it with the bit of garlic, till it
      looked as polished as a new dining-table. That done, he turned the bread,
      crumb uppermost, and saturated it with oil, added a few drops of vinegar,
      sprinkled with pepper and salt, and, with a gleam of something very like
      greediness in his bright eyes, took up the knife to cut himself a first
      mouthful of the horrible mess that he had just concocted. &ldquo;The best of
      breakfasts,&rdquo; said the Professor, seeing me look amazed. &ldquo;Not a cannibal
      meal of chicken-life in embryo (vulgarly called an egg); not a dog&rsquo;s gorge
      of a dead animal&rsquo;s flesh, blood and bones, warmed with fire (popularly
      known as a chop); not a breakfast, sir, that lions, tigers, Caribbees, and
      costermongers could all partake of alike; but an innocent, nutritive,
      simple, vegetable meal; a philosopher&rsquo;s refection, a breakfast that a
      prize-fighter would turn from in disgust, and that a Plato would share
      with relish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have no doubt that he was right, and that I was prejudiced; but as I saw
      the first oily, vinegary, garlicky morsel slide noiselessly into his
      mouth, I began to feel rather sick. My hands were dirty with moving the
      books, and I asked if I could wash them before beginning to work at the
      likeness, as a good excuse for getting out of the room, while Professor
      Tizzi was unctuously disposing of his simple vegetable meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher looked a little astonished at my request, as if the
      washing of hands at irregular times and seasons offered a comparatively
      new subject of contemplation to him; but he rang a hand-bell on his table
      immediately, and told the old servant to take me up into his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the parlor had astonished me; but a sight of the bedroom
      was a new sensation&mdash;not of the most agreeable kind. The couch on
      which the philosopher sought repose after his labors was a truckle-bed
      that would not have fetched half a crown at a sale. On one side of it
      dangled from the ceiling a complete male skeleton, looking like all that
      was left of a man who might have hung himself about a century ago, and who
      had never been disturbed since the moment of his suicide. On the other
      side of the bed stood a long press, in which I observed hideous colored
      preparations of the muscular system, and bottles with curious, twining,
      thread-like substances inside them, which might have been remarkable worms
      or dissections of nerves, scattered amicably side by side with the
      Professor&rsquo;s hair-brush (three parts worn out), with remnants of his beard
      on bits of shaving-paper, with a broken shoe-horn, and with a traveling
      looking-glass of the sort usually sold at sixpence apiece. Repetitions of
      the litter of books in the parlor lay all about over the floor; colored
      anatomical prints were nailed anyhow against the walls; rolled-up towels
      were scattered here, there, and everywhere in the wildest confusion, as if
      the room had been bombarded with them; and last, but by no means least
      remarkable among the other extraordinary objects in the bed-chamber, the
      stuffed figure of a large unshaven poodle-dog, stood on an old card-table,
      keeping perpetual watch over a pair of the philosopher&rsquo;s black breeches
      twisted round his forepaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had started, on entering the room, at the skeleton, and I started once
      more at the dog. The old servant noticed me each time with a sardonic
      grin. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;one is as dead as the other.&rdquo; With
      these words, he left me to wash my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding little more than a pint of water at my disposal, and failing
      altogether to discover where the soap was kept, I was not long in
      performing my ablutions. Before leaving the room, I looked again at the
      stuffed poodle. On the board to which he was fixed, I saw painted in faded
      letters the word &ldquo;Scarammuccia,&rdquo; evidently the comic Italian name to which
      he had answered in his lifetime. There was no other inscription; but I
      made up my mind that the dog must have been the Professor&rsquo;s pet, and that
      he kept the animal stuffed in his bedroom as a remembrance of past times.
      &ldquo;Who would have suspected so great a philosopher of having so much heart!&rdquo;
       thought I, leaving the bedroom to go downstairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor had done his breakfast, and was anxious to begin the
      sitting; so I took out my chalks and paper, and set to work at once&mdash;I
      seated on one pile of books and he on another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine anatomical preparations in my room, are there not, Mr. Kerby?&rdquo; said
      the old gentleman. &ldquo;Did you notice a very interesting and perfect
      arrangement of the intestinal ganglia? They form the subject of an
      important chapter in my great work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you will think me very ignorant,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But I really do
      not know the intestinal ganglia when I see them. The object I noticed with
      most curiosity in your room was something more on a level with my own
      small capacity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was that?&rdquo; asked the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The figure of the stuffed poodle. I suppose he was a favorite of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of mine? No, no; a young woman&rsquo;s favorite, sir, before I was born; and a
      very remarkable dog, too. The vital principle in that poodle, Mr. Kerby,
      must have been singularly intensified. He lived to a fabulous old age, and
      he was clever enough to play an important part of his own in what you
      English call a Romance of Real Life! If I could only have dissected that
      poodle, I would have put him into my book; he should have headed my
      chapter on the Vital Principle of Beasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a story in prospect,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;if I can only keep his
      attention up to the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He should have figured in my great work, sir,&rdquo; the Professor went on.
      &ldquo;Scarammuccia should have taken his place among the examples that prove my
      new theory; but unfortunately he died before I was born. His mistress gave
      him, stuffed, as you see upstairs, to my father to take care of for her,
      and he has descended as an heirloom to me. Talking of dogs, Mr. Kerby, I
      have ascertained, beyond the possibility of doubt, that the brachial
      plexus in people who die of hydrophobia&mdash;but stop! I had better show
      you how it is&mdash;the preparation is upstairs under my wash-hand stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left his seat as he spoke. In another minute he would have sent the
      servant to fetch the &ldquo;preparation,&rdquo; and I should have lost the story. At
      the risk of his taking offense, I begged him not to move just then, unless
      he wished me to spoil his likeness. This alarmed, but fortunately did not
      irritate him. He returned to his seat, and I resumed the subject of the
      stuffed poodle, asking him boldly to tell me the story with which the dog
      was connected. The demand seemed to impress him with no very favorable
      opinion of my intellectual tastes; but he complied with it, and related,
      not without many a wearisome digression to the subject of his great work,
      the narrative which I propose calling by the name of &ldquo;The Yellow Mask.&rdquo;
       After the slight specimens that I have given of his character and style of
      conversation, it will be almost unnecessary for me to premise that I tell
      this story as I have told the last, and &ldquo;Sister Rose,&rdquo; in my own language,
      and according to my own plan in the disposition of the incidents&mdash;adding
      nothing, of course, to the facts, but keeping them within the limits which
      my disposable space prescribes to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may perhaps be allowed to add in this place, that I have not yet seen or
      heard of my portrait in an engraved state. Professor Tizzi is still alive;
      but I look in vain through the publishers&rsquo; lists for an announcement of
      his learned work on the Vital Principle. Possibly he may be adding a
      volume or two to the twelve already completed, by way of increasing the
      debt which a deeply obliged posterity is, sooner or later, sure of owing
      to him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      About a century ago, there lived in the ancient city of Pisa a famous
      Italian milliner, who, by way of vindicating to all customers her
      familiarity with Paris fashions, adopted a French title, and called
      herself the Demoiselle Grifoni. She was a wizen little woman with a
      mischievous face, a quick tongue, a nimble foot, a talent for business,
      and an uncertain disposition. Rumor hinted that she was immensely rich,
      and scandal suggested that she would do anything for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one undeniable good quality which raised Demoiselle Grifoni above all
      her rivals in the trade was her inexhaustible fortitude. She was never
      known to yield an inch under any pressure of adverse circumstances. Thus
      the memorable occasion of her life on which she was threatened with ruin
      was also the occasion on which she most triumphantly asserted the energy
      and decision of her character. At the height of the demoiselle&rsquo;s
      prosperity her skilled forewoman and cutter-out basely married and started
      in business as her rival. Such a calamity as this would have ruined an
      ordinary milliner; but the invincible Grifoni rose superior to it almost
      without an effort, and proved incontestably that it was impossible for
      hostile Fortune to catch her at the end of her resources. While the minor
      milliners were prophesying that she would shut up shop, she was quietly
      carrying on a private correspondence with an agent in Paris. Nobody knew
      what these letters were about until a few weeks had elapsed, and then
      circulars were received by all the ladies in Pisa, announcing that the
      best French forewoman who could be got for money was engaged to
      superintend the great Grifoni establishment. This master-stroke decided
      the victory. All the demoiselle&rsquo;s customers declined giving orders
      elsewhere until the forewoman from Paris had exhibited to the natives of
      Pisa the latest fashions from the metropolis of the world of dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchwoman arrived punctual to the appointed day&mdash;glib and curt,
      smiling and flippant, tight of face and supple of figure. Her name was
      Mademoiselle Virginie, and her family had inhumanly deserted her. She was
      set to work the moment she was inside the doors of the Grifoni
      establishment. A room was devoted to her own private use; magnificent
      materials in velvet, silk, and satin, with due accompaniment of muslins,
      laces, and ribbons were placed at her disposal; she was told to spare no
      expense, and to produce, in the shortest possible time, the finest and
      nearest specimen dresses for exhibition in the show-room. Mademoiselle
      Virginie undertook to do everything required of her, produced her
      portfolios of patterns and her book of colored designs, and asked for one
      assistant who could speak French enough to interpret her orders to the
      Italian girls in the work-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the very person you want,&rdquo; cried Demoiselle Grifoni. &ldquo;A work-woman
      we call Brigida here&mdash;the idlest slut in Pisa, but as sharp as a
      needle&mdash;has been in France, and speaks the language like a native.
      I&rsquo;ll send her to you directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Virginie was not left long alone with her patterns and silks.
      A tall woman, with bold black eyes, a reckless manner, and a step as firm
      as a man&rsquo;s, stalked into the room with the gait of a tragedy-queen
      crossing the stage. The instant her eyes fell on the French forewoman, she
      stopped, threw up her hands in astonishment, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Finette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teresa!&rdquo; cried the Frenchwoman, casting her scissors on the table, and
      advancing a few steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! call me Brigida.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! call me Virginie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These two exclamations were uttered at the same moment, and then the two
      women scrutinized each other in silence. The swarthy cheeks of the Italian
      turned to a dull yellow, and the voice of the Frenchwoman trembled a
      little when she spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, in the name of Heaven, have you dropped down in the world as low as
      this?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I thought you were provided for when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; interrupted Brigida. &ldquo;You see I was not provided for. I have
      had my misfortunes; and you are the last woman alive who ought to refer to
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I have not had my misfortunes, too, since we met?&rdquo;
       (Brigida&rsquo;s face brightened maliciously at those words.) &ldquo;You have had your
      revenge,&rdquo; continued Mademoiselle Virginie, coldly, turning away to the
      table and taking up the scissors again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brigida followed her, threw one arm roughly round her neck, and kissed her
      on the cheek. &ldquo;Let us be friends again,&rdquo; she said. The Frenchwoman
      laughed. &ldquo;Tell me how I have had my revenge,&rdquo; pursued the other,
      tightening her grasp. Mademoiselle Virginie signed to Brigida to stoop,
      and whispered rapidly in her ear. The Italian listened eagerly, with
      fierce, suspicious eyes fixed on the door. When the whispering ceased, she
      loosened her hold, and, with a sigh of relief, pushed back her heavy black
      hair from her temples. &ldquo;Now we are friends,&rdquo; she said, and sat down
      indolently in a chair placed by the worktable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; repeated Mademoiselle Virginie, with another laugh. &ldquo;And now
      for business,&rdquo; she continued, getting a row of pins ready for use by
      putting them between her teeth. &ldquo;I am here, I believe, for the purpose of
      ruining the late forewoman, who has set up in opposition to us? Good! I <i>will</i>
      ruin her. Spread out the yellow brocaded silk, my dear, and pin that
      pattern on at your end, while I pin at mine. And what are your plans,
      Brigida? (Mind you don&rsquo;t forget that Finette is dead, and that Virginie
      has risen from her ashes.) You can&rsquo;t possibly intend to stop here all your
      life? (Leave an inch outside the paper, all round.) You must have
      projects? What are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at my figure,&rdquo; said Brigida, placing herself in an attitude in the
      middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; rejoined the other, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what it was. There&rsquo;s too much of it.
      You want diet, walking, and a French stay-maker,&rdquo; muttered Mademoiselle
      Virginie through her chevaus-defrise of pins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the goddess Minerva walk, and employ a French stay-maker? I thought
      she rode upon clouds, and lived at a period before waists were invented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This&mdash;that my present project is to try if I can&rsquo;t make my fortune
      by sitting as a model for Minerva in the studio of the best sculptor in
      Pisa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is he! (Unwind me a yard or two of that black lace.)&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The master-sculptor, Luca Lomi&mdash;an old family, once noble, but down
      in the world now. The master is obliged to make statues to get a living
      for his daughter and himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More of the lace&mdash;double it over the bosom of the dress. And how is
      sitting to this needy sculptor to make your fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute. There are other sculptors besides him in the studio. There
      is, first, his brother, the priest&mdash;Father Rocco, who passes all his
      spare time with the master. He is a good sculptor in his way&mdash;has
      cast statues and made a font for his church&mdash;a holy man, who devotes
      all his work in the studio to the cause of piety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, bah! we should think him a droll priest in France. (More pins.) You
      don&rsquo;t expect <i>him</i> to put money in your pocket, surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, I say again. There is a third sculptor in the studio&mdash;actually
      a nobleman! His name is Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli. He is rich, young, handsome, an
      only child, and little better than a fool. Fancy his working at sculpture,
      as if he had his bread to get by it&mdash;and thinking that an amusement!
      Imagine a man belonging to one of the best families in Pisa mad enough to
      want to make a reputation as an artist! Wait! wait! the best is to come.
      His father and mother are dead&mdash;he has no near relations in the world
      to exercise authority over him&mdash;he is a bachelor, and his fortune is
      all at his own disposal; going a-begging, my friend; absolutely going
      a-begging for want of a clever woman to hold out her hand and take it from
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;now I understand. The goddess Minerva is a clever woman,
      and she will hold out her hand and take his fortune from him with the
      utmost docility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first thing is to get him to offer it. I must tell you that I am not
      going to sit to him, but to his master, Luca Lomi, who is doing the statue
      of Minerva. The face is modeled from his daughter; and now he wants
      somebody to sit for the bust and arms. Maddalena Lomi and I are as nearly
      as possible the same height, I hear&mdash;the difference between us being
      that I have a good figure and she has a bad one. I have offered to sit,
      through a friend who is employed in the studio. If the master accepts, I
      am sure of an introduction to our rich young gentleman; and then leave it
      to my good looks, my various accomplishments, and my ready tongue, to do
      the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! I won&rsquo;t have the lace doubled, on second thoughts. I&rsquo;ll have it
      single, and running all round the dress in curves&mdash;so. Well, and who
      is this friend of yours employed in the studio? A fourth sculptor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; the strangest, simplest little creature&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a faint tap was audible at the door of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brigida laid her finger on her lips, and called impatiently to the person
      outside to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened gently, and a young girl, poorly but very neatly dressed,
      entered the room. She was rather thin and under the average height; but
      her head and figure were in perfect proportion. Her hair was of that
      gorgeous auburn color, her eyes of that deep violet-blue, which the
      portraits of Giorgione and Titian have made famous as the type of Venetian
      beauty. Her features possessed the definiteness and regularity, the &ldquo;good
      modeling&rdquo; (to use an artist&rsquo;s term), which is the rarest of all womanly
      charms, in Italy as elsewhere. The one serious defect of her face was its
      paleness. Her cheeks, wanting nothing in form, wanted everything in color.
      That look of health, which is the essential crowning-point of beauty, was
      the one attraction which her face did not possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came into the room with a sad and weary expression in her eyes, which
      changed, however, the moment she observed the magnificently-dressed French
      forewoman, into a look of astonishment, and almost of awe. Her manner
      became shy and embarrassed; and after an instant of hesitation, she turned
      back silently to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop, Nanina,&rdquo; said Brigida, in Italian. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of that
      lady. She is our new forewoman; and she has it in her power to do all
      sorts of kind things for you. Look up, and tell us what you want. You were
      sixteen last birthday, Nanina, and you behave like a baby of two years
      old!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only came to know if there was any work for me to-day,&rdquo; said the girl,
      in a very sweet voice, that trembled a little as she tried to face the
      fashionable French forewoman again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No work, child, that is easy enough for you to do,&rdquo; said Brigida. &ldquo;Are
      you going to the studio to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the color that Nanina&rsquo;s cheeks wanted began to steal over them as
      she answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget my message, darling. And if Master Luca Lomi asks where I
      live, answer that you are ready to deliver a letter to me; but that you
      are forbidden to enter into any particulars at first about who I am, or
      where I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why am I forbidden?&rdquo; inquired Nanina, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask questions, baby! Do as you are told. Bring me back a nice note
      or message to-morrow from the studio, and I will intercede with this lady
      to get you some work. You are a foolish child to want it, when you might
      make more money here and at Florence, by sitting to painters and
      sculptors; though what they can see to paint or model in you I never could
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like working at home better than going abroad to sit,&rdquo; said Nanina,
      looking very much abashed as she faltered out the answer, and escaping
      from the room with a terrified farewell obeisance, which was an eccentric
      compound of a start, a bow, and a courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That awkward child would be pretty,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Virginie, making
      rapid progress with the cutting-out of her dress, &ldquo;if she knew how to give
      herself a complexion, and had a presentable gown on her back. Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The friend who is to get me into Master Luca Lomi&rsquo;s studio,&rdquo; replied
      Brigida, laughing. &ldquo;Rather a curious ally for me to take up with, isn&rsquo;t
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you meet with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, to be sure; she hangs about this place for any plain work she can
      get to do, and takes it home to the oddest little room in a street near
      the Campo Santo. I had the curiosity to follow her one day, and knocked at
      her door soon after she had gone in, as if I was a visitor. She answered
      my knock in a great flurry and fright, as you may imagine. I made myself
      agreeable, affected immense interest in her affairs, and so got into her
      room. Such a place! A mere corner of it curtained off to make a bedroom.
      One chair, one stool, one saucepan on the fire. Before the hearth the most
      grotesquely hideous unshaven poodle-dog you ever saw; and on the stool a
      fair little girl plaiting dinner-mats. Such was the household&mdash;furniture
      and all included. &lsquo;Where is your father?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;He ran away and left
      us years ago,&rsquo; answers my awkward little friend who has just left the
      room, speaking in that simple way of hers, with all the composure in the
      world. &lsquo;And your mother?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Dead.&rsquo; She went up to the little
      mat-plaiting girl as she gave that answer, and began playing with her long
      flaxen hair. &lsquo;Your sister, I suppose,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;What is her name?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;They
      call me La Biondella,&rsquo; says the child, looking up from her mat (La
      Biondella, Virginie, means The Fair). &lsquo;And why do you let that great,
      shaggy, ill-looking brute lie before your fireplace?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried
      the little mat-plaiter, &lsquo;that is our dear old dog, Scarammuccia. He takes
      care of the house when Nanina is not at home. He dances on his hind legs,
      and jumps through a hoop, and tumbles down dead when I cry Bang!
      Scarammuccia followed us home one night, years ago, and he has lived with
      us ever since. He goes out every day by himself, we can&rsquo;t tell where, and
      generally returns licking his chops, which makes us afraid that he is a
      thief; but nobody finds him out, because he is the cleverest dog that ever
      lived!&rsquo; The child ran on in this way about the great beast by the
      fireplace, till I was obliged to stop her; while that simpleton Nanina
      stood by, laughing and encouraging her. I asked them a few more questions,
      which produced some strange answers. They did not seem to know of any
      relations of theirs in the world. The neighbors in the house had helped
      them, after their father ran away, until they were old enough to help
      themselves; and they did not seem to think there was anything in the least
      wretched or pitiable in their way of living. The last thing I heard, when
      I left them that day, was La Biondella crying &lsquo;Bang!&rsquo;&mdash;then a bark, a
      thump on the floor, and a scream of laughter. If it was not for their dog,
      I should go and see them oftener. But the ill-conditioned beast has taken
      a dislike to me, and growls and shows his teeth whenever I come near him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl looked sickly when she came in here. Is she always like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She has altered within the last month. I suspect our interesting
      young nobleman has produced an impression. The oftener the girl has sat to
      him lately, the paler and more out of spirits she has become.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she has sat to him, has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is sitting to him now. He is doing a bust of some Pagan nymph or
      other, and prevailed on Nanina to let him copy from her head and face.
      According to her own account the little fool was frightened at first, and
      gave him all the trouble in the world before she would consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now she has consented, don&rsquo;t you think it likely she may turn out
      rather a dangerous rival? Men are such fools, and take such fancies into
      their heads&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ridiculous! A thread-paper of a girl like that, who has no manner, no
      talk, no intelligence; who has nothing to recommend her but an awkward,
      babyish prettiness! Dangerous to me? No, no! If there is danger at all, I
      have to dread it from the sculptor&rsquo;s daughter. I don&rsquo;t mind confessing
      that I am anxious to see Maddalena Lomi. But as for Nanina, she will
      simply be of use to me. All I know already about the studio and the
      artists in it, I know through her. She will deliver my message, and
      procure me my introduction; and when we have got so far, I shall give her
      an old gown and a shake of the hand; and then, good-by to our little
      innocent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, for your sake I hope you are the wiser of the two in this
      matter. For my part, I always distrust innocence. Wait one moment, and I
      shall have the body and sleeves of this dress ready for the needle-women.
      There, ring the bell, and order them up; for I have directions to give,
      and you must interpret for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Brigida went to the bell, the energetic Frenchwoman began planning
      out the skirt of the new dress. She laughed as she measured off yard after
      yard of the silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing about?&rdquo; asked Brigida, opening the door and ringing
      a hand-bell in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help fancying, dear, in spite of her innocent face and her
      artless ways, that your young friend is a hypocrite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am quite certain, love, that she is only a simpleton.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The studio of the master-sculptor, Luca Lomi, was composed of two large
      rooms unequally divided by a wooden partition, with an arched doorway cut
      in the middle of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the milliners of the Grifoni establishment were industriously
      shaping dresses, the sculptors in Luca Lomi&rsquo;s workshop were, in their way,
      quite as hard at work shaping marble and clay. In the smaller of the two
      rooms the young nobleman (only addressed in the studio by his Christian
      name of Fabio) was busily engaged on his bust, with Nanina sitting before
      him as a model. His was not one of those traditional Italian faces from
      which subtlety and suspicion are always supposed to look out darkly on the
      world at large. Both countenance and expression proclaimed his character
      frankly and freely to all who saw him. Quick intelligence looked brightly
      from his eyes; and easy good humor laughed out pleasantly in the rather
      quaint curve of his lips. For the rest, his face expressed the defects as
      well as the merits of his character, showing that he wanted resolution and
      perseverance just as plainly as it showed also that he possessed
      amiability and intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the large room, nearest to the street door, Luca Lomi was
      standing by his life-size statue of Minerva; and was issuing directions,
      from time to time, to some of his workmen, who were roughly chiseling the
      drapery of another figure. At the opposite side of the room, nearest to
      the partition, his brother, Father Rocco, was taking a cast from a
      statuette of the Madonna; while Maddalena Lomi, the sculptor&rsquo;s daughter,
      released from sitting for Minerva&rsquo;s face, walked about the two rooms, and
      watched what was going on in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strong family likeness of a certain kind between father,
      brother and daughter. All three were tall, handsome, dark-haired, and
      dark-eyed; nevertheless, they differed in expression, strikingly as they
      resembled one another in feature. Maddalena Lomi&rsquo;s face betrayed strong
      passions, but not an ungenerous nature. Her father, with the same
      indications of a violent temper, had some sinister lines about his mouth
      and forehead which suggested anything rather than an open disposition.
      Father Rocco&rsquo;s countenance, on the other hand, looked like the
      personification of absolute calmness and invincible moderation; and his
      manner, which, in a very firm way, was singularly quiet and deliberate,
      assisted in carrying out the impression produced by his face. The daughter
      seemed as if she could fly into a passion at a moment&rsquo;s notice, and
      forgive also at a moment&rsquo;s notice. The father, appearing to be just as
      irritable, had something in his face which said, as plainly as if in
      words, &ldquo;Anger me, and I never pardon.&rdquo; The priest looked as if he need
      never be called on either to ask forgiveness or to grant it, for the
      double reason that he could irritate nobody else, and that nobody else
      could irritate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rocco,&rdquo; said Luca, looking at the face of his Minerva, which was now
      finished, &ldquo;this statue of mine will make a sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; rejoined the priest, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a new thing in art,&rdquo; continued Luca, enthusiastically. &ldquo;Other
      sculptors, with a classical subject like mine, limit themselves to the
      ideal classical face, and never think of aiming at individual character.
      Now I do precisely the reverse of that. I get my handsome daughter,
      Maddalena, to sit for Minerva, and I make an exact likeness of her. I may
      lose in ideal beauty, but I gain in individual character. People may
      accuse me of disregarding established rules; but my answer is, that I make
      my own rules. My daughter looks like a Minerva, and there she is exactly
      as she looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly a wonderful likeness,&rdquo; said Father Rocco, approaching the
      statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It the girl herself,&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;Exactly her expression, and
      exactly her features. Measure Maddalena, and measure Minerva, and from
      forehead to chin, you won&rsquo;t find a hair-breadth of difference between
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about the bust and arms of the figure, now the face is done?&rdquo;
       asked the priest, returning, as he spoke, to his own work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have the very model I want for them to-morrow. Little Nanina has
      just given me the strangest message. What do you think of a mysterious
      lady admirer who offers to sit for the bust and arms of my Minerva?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to accept the offer?&rdquo; inquired the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to receive her to-morrow; and if I really find that she is the
      same height as Maddalena, and has a bust and arms worth modeling, of
      course I shall accept her offer; for she will be the very sitter I have
      been looking after for weeks past. Who can she be? That&rsquo;s the mystery I
      want to find out. Which do you say, Rocco&mdash;an enthusiast or an
      adventuress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not presume to say, for I have no means of knowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you are with your moderation again. Now, I do presume to assert
      that she must be either one or the other&mdash;or she would not have
      forbidden Nanina to say anything about her in answer to all my first
      natural inquiries. Where is Maddalena? I thought she was here a minute
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in Fabio&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; answered Father Rocco, softly. &ldquo;Shall I call
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; returned Luca. He stopped, looked round at the workmen, who were
      chipping away mechanically at their bit of drapery; then advanced close to
      the priest, with a cunning smile, and continued in a whisper, &ldquo;If
      Maddalena can only get from Fabio&rsquo;s room here to Fabio&rsquo;s palace over the
      way, on the Arno&mdash;come, come, Rocco! don&rsquo;t shake your head. If I
      brought her up to your church door one of these days, as Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli&rsquo;s
      betrothed, you would be glad enough to take the rest of the business off
      my hands, and make her Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli&rsquo;s wife. You are a very holy man,
      Rocco, but you know the difference between the clink of the money-bag and
      the clink of the chisel for all that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to find, Luca,&rdquo; returned the priest, coldly, &ldquo;that you allow
      yourself to talk of the most delicate subjects in the coarsest way. This
      is one of the minor sins of the tongue which is growing on you. When we
      are alone in the studio, I will endeavor to lead you into speaking of the
      young man in the room there, and of your daughter, in terms more becoming
      to you, to me, and to them. Until that time, allow me to go on with my
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luca shrugged his shoulders, and went back to his statue. Father Rocco,
      who had been engaged during the last ten minutes in mixing wet plaster to
      the right consistency for taking a cast, suspended his occupation; and
      crossing the room to a corner next the partition, removed from it a
      cheval-glass which stood there. He lifted it away gently, while his
      brother&rsquo;s back was turned, carried it close to the table at which he had
      been at work, and then resumed his employment of mixing the plaster.
      Having at last prepared the composition for use, he laid it over the
      exposed half of the statuette with a neatness and dexterity which showed
      him to be a practiced hand at cast-taking. Just as he had covered the
      necessary extent of surface, Luca turned round from his statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you getting on with the cast?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Do you want any help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, brother, I thank you,&rdquo; answered the priest. &ldquo;Pray do not disturb
      either yourself or your workmen on my account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luca turned again to the statue; and, at the same moment, Father Rocco
      softly moved the cheval-glass toward the open doorway between the two
      rooms, placing it at such an angle as to make it reflect the figures of
      the persons in the smaller studio. He did this with significant quickness
      and precision. It was evidently not the first time he had used the glass
      for purposes of secret observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically stirring the wet plaster round and round for the second
      casting, the priest looked into the glass, and saw, as in a picture, all
      that was going forward in the inner room. Maddalena Lomi was standing
      behind the young nobleman, watching the progress he made with his bust.
      Occasionally she took the modeling tool out of his hand, and showed him,
      with her sweetest smile, that she, too, as a sculptor&rsquo;s daughter,
      understood something of the sculptor&rsquo;s art; and now and then, in the
      pauses of the conversation, when her interest was especially intense in
      Fabio&rsquo;s work, she suffered her hand to drop absently on his shoulder, or
      stooped forward so close to him that her hair mingled for a moment with
      his. Moving the glass an inch or two, so as to bring Nanina well under his
      eye, Father Rocco found that he could trace each repetition of these
      little acts of familiarity by the immediate effect which they produced on
      the girl&rsquo;s face and manner. Whenever Maddalena so much as touched the
      young nobleman&mdash;no matter whether she did so by premeditation, or
      really by accident&mdash;Nanina&rsquo;s features contracted, her pale cheeks
      grew paler, she fidgeted on her chair, and her fingers nervously twisted
      and untwisted the loose ends of the ribbon fastened round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealous,&rdquo; thought Father Rocco; &ldquo;I suspected it weeks ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, and gave his whole attention for a few minutes to the
      mixing of the plaster. When he looked back again at the glass, he was just
      in time to witness a little accident which suddenly changed the relative
      positions of the three persons in the inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Maddalena take up a modeling tool which lay on a table near her,
      and begin to help Fabio in altering the arrangement of the hair in his
      bust. The young man watched what she was doing earnestly enough for a few
      moments; then his attention wandered away to Nanina. She looked at him
      reproachfully, and he answered by a sign which brought a smile to her face
      directly. Maddalena surprised her at the instant of the change; and,
      following the direction of her eyes, easily discovered at whom the smile
      was directed. She darted a glance of contempt at Nanina, threw down the
      modeling tool, and turned indignantly to the young sculptor, who was
      affecting to be hard at work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Fabio,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the next time you forget what is due to your
      rank and yourself, warn me of it, if you please, beforehand, and I will
      take care to leave the room.&rdquo; While speaking the last words, she passed
      through the doorway. Father Rocco, bending abstractedly over his plaster
      mixture, heard her continue to herself in a whisper, as she went by him,
      &ldquo;If I have any influence at all with my father, that impudent beggar-girl
      shall be forbidden the studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealousy on the other side,&rdquo; thought the priest. &ldquo;Something must be done
      at once, or this will end badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked again at the glass, and saw Fabio, after an instant of
      hesitation, beckon to Nanina to approach him. She left her seat, advanced
      half-way to his, then stopped. He stepped forward to meet her, and, taking
      her by the hand, whispered earnestly in her ear. When he had done, before
      dropping her hand, he touched her cheek with his lips, and then helped her
      on with the little white mantilla which covered her head and shoulders
      out-of-doors. The girl trembled violently, and drew the linen close to her
      face as Fabio walked into the larger studio, and, addressing Father Rocco,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I am more idle, or more stupid, than ever to-day. I can&rsquo;t get
      on with the bust at all to my satisfaction, so I have cut short the
      sitting, and given Nanina a half-holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the first sound of his voice, Maddalena, who was speaking to her
      father, stopped, and, with another look of scorn at Nanina standing
      trembling in the doorway, left the room. Luca Lomi called Fabio to him as
      she went away, and Father Rocco, turning to the statuette, looked to see
      how the plaster was hardening on it. Seeing them thus engaged, Nanina
      attempted to escape from the studio without being noticed; but the priest
      stopped her just as she was hurrying by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said he, in his gentle, quiet way, &ldquo;are you going home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina&rsquo;s heart beat too fast for her to reply in words; she could only
      answer by bowing her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this for your little sister,&rdquo; pursued Father Rocco, putting a few
      silver coins in her hand; &ldquo;I have got some customers for those mats she
      plaits so nicely. You need not bring them to my rooms; I will come and see
      you this evening, when I am going my rounds among my parishioners, and
      will take the mats away with me. You are a good girl, Nanina&mdash;you
      have always been a good girl&mdash;and as long as I am alive, my child,
      you shall never want a friend and an adviser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. She drew the mantilla closer than ever
      round her face, as she tried to thank the priest. Father Rocco nodded to
      her kindly, and laid his hand lightly on her head for a moment, then
      turned round again to his cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget my message to the lady who is to sit to me to-morrow,&rdquo; said
      Luca to Nanina, as she passed him on her way out of the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had gone, Fabio returned to the priest, who was still busy over
      his cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will get on better with the bust to-morrow,&rdquo; said Father
      Rocco, politely; &ldquo;I am sure you cannot complain of your model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Complain of her!&rdquo; cried the young man, warmly; &ldquo;she has the most
      beautiful head I ever saw. If I were twenty times the sculptor that I am,
      I should despair of being able to do her justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked into the inner room to look at his bust again&mdash;lingered
      before it for a little while&mdash;and then turned to retrace his steps to
      the larger studio. Between him and the doorway stood three chairs. As he
      went by them, he absently touched the backs of the first two, and passed
      the third; but just as he was entering the larger room, stopped, as if
      struck by a sudden recollection, returned hastily, and touched the third
      chair. Raising his eyes, as he approached the large studio again after
      doing this, he met the eyes of the priest fixed on him in unconcealed
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Fabio!&rdquo; exclaimed Father Rocco, with a sarcastic smile, &ldquo;who would
      ever have imagined that you were superstitious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nurse was,&rdquo; returned the young man, reddening, and laughing rather
      uneasily. &ldquo;She taught me some bad habits that I have not got over yet.&rdquo;
       With those words he nodded and hastily went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Superstitious,&rdquo; said Father Rocco softly to himself. He smiled again,
      reflected for a moment, and then, going to the window, looked into the
      street. The way to the left led to Fabio&rsquo;s palace, and the way to the
      right to the Campo Santo, in the neighborhood of which Nanina lived. The
      priest was just in time to see the young sculptor take the way to the
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      After another half-hour had elapsed, the two workmen quitted the studio to
      go to dinner, and Luca and his brother were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may return now,&rdquo; said Father Rocco, &ldquo;to that conversation which was
      suspended between us earlier in the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing more to say,&rdquo; rejoined Luca, sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can listen to me, brother, with the greater attention,&rdquo; pursued
      the priest. &ldquo;I objected to the coarseness of your tone in talking of our
      young pupil and your daughter; I object still more strongly to your
      insinuation that my desire to see them married (provided always that they
      are sincerely attached to each other) springs from a mercenary motive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are trying to snare me, Rocco, in a mesh of fine phrases; but I am
      not to be caught. I know what my own motive is for hoping that Maddalena
      may get an offer of marriage from this wealthy young gentleman&mdash;she
      will have his money, and we shall all profit by it. That is coarse and
      mercenary, if you please; but it is the true reason why I want to see
      Maddalena married to Fabio. You want to see it, too&mdash;and for what
      reason, I should like to know, if not for mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what use would wealthy relations be to me? What are people with money&mdash;what
      is money itself&mdash;to a man who follows my calling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money is something to everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? When have you found that I have taken any account of it? Give me
      money enough to buy my daily bread, and to pay for my lodging and my
      coarse cassock, and though I may want much for the poor, for myself I want
      no more. Then have you found me mercenary? Do I not help you in this
      studio, for love of you and of the art, without exacting so much as
      journeyman&rsquo;s wages? Have I ever asked you for more than a few crowns to
      give away on feast-days among my parishioners? Money! money for a man who
      may be summoned to Rome to-morrow, who may be told to go at half an hour&rsquo;s
      notice on a foreign mission that may take him to the ends of the earth,
      and who would be ready to go the moment when he was called on! Money to a
      man who has no wife, no children, no interests outside the sacred circle
      of the Church! Brother, do you see the dust and dirt and shapeless marble
      chips lying around your statue there? Cover that floor instead with gold,
      and, though the litter may have changed in color and form, in my eyes it
      would be litter still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very noble sentiment, I dare say, Rocco, but I can&rsquo;t echo it. Granting
      that you care nothing for money, will you explain to me why you are so
      anxious that Maddalena should marry Fabio? She has had offers from poorer
      men&mdash;you knew of them&mdash;but you have never taken the least
      interest in her accepting or rejecting a proposal before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hinted the reason to you, months ago, when Fabio first entered the
      studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was rather a vague hint, brother; can&rsquo;t you be plainer to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can. In the first place, let me begin by assuring you that I
      have no objection to the young man himself. He may be a little capricious
      and undecided, but he has no incorrigible faults that I have discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is rather a cool way of praising him, Rocco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should speak of him warmly enough, if he were not the representative of
      an intolerable corruption, and a monstrous wrong. Whenever I think of him
      I think of an injury which his present existence perpetuates; and if I do
      speak of him coldly, it is only for that reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luca looked away quickly from his brother, and began kicking absently at
      the marble chips which were scattered over the floor around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I now remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what that hint of yours pointed at. I know
      what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know,&rdquo; answered the priest, &ldquo;that while part of the wealth which
      Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli possesses is honestly and incontestably his own; part,
      also, has been inherited by him from the spoilers and robbers of the
      Church&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blame his ancestors for that; don&rsquo;t blame him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blame him as long as the spoil is not restored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that it was spoil, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have examined more carefully than most men the records of the civil
      wars in Italy; and I know that the ancestors of Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli wrung from
      the Church, in her hour of weakness, property which they dared to claim as
      their right. I know of titles to lands signed away, in those stormy times,
      under the influence of fear, or through false representations of which the
      law takes no account. I call the money thus obtained spoil, and I say that
      it ought to be restored, and shall be restored, to the Church from which
      it was taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does Fabio answer to that, brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not spoken to him on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have, as yet, no influence over him. When he is married, his
      wife will have influence over him, and she shall speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maddalena, I suppose? How do you know that she will speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not educated her? Does she not understand what her duties are
      toward the Church, in whose bosom she has been reared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luca hesitated uneasily, and walked away a step or two before he spoke
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does this spoil, as you call it, amount to a large sum of money?&rdquo; he
      asked, in an anxious whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may answer that question, Luca, at some future time,&rdquo; said the priest.
      &ldquo;For the present, let it be enough that you are acquainted with all I
      undertook to inform you of when we began our conversation. You now know
      that if I am anxious for this marriage to take place, it is from motives
      entirely unconnected with self-interest. If all the property which Fabio&rsquo;s
      ancestors wrongfully obtained from the Church were restored to the Church
      to-morrow, not one paulo of it would go into my pocket. I am a poor priest
      now, and to the end of my days shall remain so. You soldiers of the world,
      brother, fight for your pay; I am a soldier of the Church, and I fight for
      my cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying these words, he returned abruptly to the statuette; and refused to
      speak, or leave his employment again, until he had taken the mold off, and
      had carefully put away the various fragments of which it consisted. This
      done, he drew a writing-desk from the drawer of his working-table, and
      taking out a slip of paper wrote these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down to the studio to-morrow. Fabio will be with us, but Nanina will
      return no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without signing what he had written, he sealed it up, and directed it to
      &ldquo;Donna Maddalena&rdquo;; then took his hat, and handed the note to his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oblige me by giving that to my niece,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Rocco,&rdquo; said Luca, turning the note round and round perplexedly
      between his finger and thumb; &ldquo;do you think Maddalena will be lucky enough
      to get married to Fabio?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still coarse in your expressions, brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind my expressions. Is it likely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Luca, I think it is likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With those words he waved his hand pleasantly to his brother, and went
      out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the studio Father Rocco went straight to his own rooms, hard by the
      church to which he was attached. Opening a cabinet in his study, he took
      from one of its drawers a handful of small silver money, consulted for a
      minute or so a slate on which several names and addresses were written,
      provided himself with a portable inkhorn and some strips of paper, and
      again went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He directed his steps to the poorest part of the neighborhood; and
      entering some very wretched houses, was greeted by the inhabitants with
      great respect and affection. The women, especially, kissed his hands with
      more reverence than they would have shown to the highest crowned head in
      Europe. In return, he talked to them as easily and unconstrainedly as if
      they were his equals; sat down cheerfully on dirty bedsides and rickety
      benches; and distributed his little gifts of money with the air of a man
      who was paying debts rather than bestowing charity. Where he encountered
      cases of illness, he pulled out his inkhorn and slips of paper, and wrote
      simple prescriptions to be made up from the medicine-chest of a
      neighboring convent, which served the same merciful purpose then that is
      answered by dispensaries in our days. When he had exhausted his money, and
      had got through his visits, he was escorted out of the poor quarter by a
      perfect train of enthusiastic followers. The women kissed his hand again,
      and the men uncovered as he turned, and, with a friendly sign, bade them
      all farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was alone again, he walked toward the Campo Santo, and,
      passing the house in which Nanina lived, sauntered up and down the street
      thoughtfully for some minutes. When he at length ascended the steep
      staircase that led to the room occupied by the sisters, he found the door
      ajar. Pushing it open gently, he saw La Biondella sitting with her pretty,
      fair profile turned toward him, eating her evening meal of bread and
      grapes. At the opposite end of the room, Scarammuccia was perched up on
      his hindquarters in a corner, with his mouth wide open to catch the morsel
      of bread which he evidently expected the child to throw to him. What the
      elder sister was doing, the priest had not time to see; for the dog barked
      the moment he presented himself, and Nanina hastened to the door to
      ascertain who the intruder might be. All that he could observe was that
      she was too confused, on catching sight of him, to be able to utter a
      word. La Biondella was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Father Rocco,&rdquo; said the child, jumping up, with her bread in
      one hand and her grapes in the other&mdash;&ldquo;thank you for giving me so
      much money for my dinner-mats. There they are, tied up together in one
      little parcel, in the corner. Nanina said she was ashamed to think of your
      carrying them; and I said I knew where you lived, and I should like to ask
      you to let me take them home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you can carry them all the way, my dear?&rdquo; asked the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Father Rocco, see if I can&rsquo;t carry them!&rdquo; cried La Biondella,
      cramming her bread into one of the pockets of her little apron, holding
      her bunch of grapes by the stalk in her mouth, and hoisting the packet of
      dinner-mats on her head in a moment. &ldquo;See, I am strong enough to carry
      double,&rdquo; said the child, looking up proudly into the priest&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you trust her to take them home for me?&rdquo; asked Father Rocco, turning
      to Nanina. &ldquo;I want to speak to you alone, and her absence will give me the
      opportunity. Can you trust her out by herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Father Rocco, she often goes out alone.&rdquo; Nanina gave this answer in
      low, trembling tones, and looked down confusedly on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go then, my dear,&rdquo; said Father Rocco, patting the child on the shoulder;
      &ldquo;and come back here to your sister, as soon as you have left the mats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Biondella went out directly in great triumph, with Scarammuccia walking
      by her side, and keeping his muzzle suspiciously close to the pocket in
      which she had put her bread. Father Rocco closed the door after them, and
      then, taking the one chair which the room possessed, motioned to Nanina to
      sit by him on the stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe that I am your friend, my child, and that I have always
      meant well toward you?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best and kindest of friends,&rdquo; answered Nanina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will hear what I have to say patiently, and you will believe
      that I am speaking for your good, even if my words should distress you?&rdquo;
       (Nanina turned away her head.) &ldquo;Now, tell me; should I be wrong, to begin
      with, if I said that my brother&rsquo;s pupil, the young nobleman whom we call
      &lsquo;Signor Fabio,&rsquo; had been here to see you to-day?&rdquo; (Nanina started up
      affrightedly from her stool.) &ldquo;Sit down again, my child; I am not going to
      blame you. I am only going to tell you what you must do for the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand; it was cold, and it trembled violently in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not ask what he has been saying to you,&rdquo; continued the priest;
      &ldquo;for it might distress you to answer, and I have, moreover, had means of
      knowing that your youth and beauty have made a strong impression on him. I
      will pass over, then, all reference to the words he may have been speaking
      to you; and I will come at once to what I have now to say, in my turn.
      Nanina, my child, arm yourself with all your courage, and promise me,
      before we part to-night, that you will see Signor Fabio no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina turned round suddenly, and fixed her eyes on him, with an
      expression of terrified incredulity. &ldquo;No more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very young and very innocent,&rdquo; said Father Rocco; &ldquo;but surely you
      must have thought before now of the difference between Signor Fabio and
      you. Surely you must have often remembered that you are low down among the
      ranks of the poor, and that he is high up among the rich and the nobly
      born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina&rsquo;s hands dropped on the priest&rsquo;s knees. She bent her head down on
      them, and began to weep bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you must have thought of that?&rdquo; reiterated Father Rocco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have often, often thought of it!&rdquo; murmured the girl &ldquo;I have mourned
      over it, and cried about it in secret for many nights past. He said I
      looked pale, and ill, and out of spirits to-day, and I told him it was
      with thinking of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he say in return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. Father Rocco looked down. Nanina raised her head
      directly from his knees, and tried to turn it away again. He took her hand
      and stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;speak frankly to me. Say what you ought to say to your
      father and your friend. What was his answer, my child, when you reminded
      him of the difference between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said I was born to be a lady,&rdquo; faltered the girl, still struggling to
      turn her face away, &ldquo;and that I might make myself one if I would learn and
      be patient. He said that if he had all the noble ladies in Pisa to choose
      from on one side, and only little Nanina on the other, he would hold out
      his hand to me, and tell them, &lsquo;This shall be my wife.&rsquo; He said love knew
      no difference of rank; and that if he was a nobleman and rich, it was all
      the more reason why he should please himself. He was so kind, that I
      thought my heart would burst while he was speaking; and my little sister
      liked him so, that she got upon his knee and kissed him. Even our dog, who
      growls at other strangers, stole to his side and licked his hand. Oh,
      Father Rocco! Father Rocco!&rdquo; The tears burst out afresh, and the lovely
      head dropped once more, wearily, on the priest&rsquo;s knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Rocco smiled to himself, and waited to speak again till she was
      calmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing,&rdquo; he resumed, after some minutes of silence, &ldquo;supposing Signor
      Fabio really meant all he said to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina started up, and confronted the priest boldly for the first time
      since he had entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her cheeks beginning to redden, and her dark
      blue eyes flashing suddenly through her tears &ldquo;Supposing! Father Rocco,
      Fabio would never deceive me. I would die here at your feet, rather than
      doubt the least word he said to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest signed to her quietly to return to the stool. &ldquo;I never
      suspected the child had so much spirit in her,&rdquo; he thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would die,&rdquo; repeated Nanina, in a voice that began to falter now. &ldquo;I
      would die rather than doubt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not ask you to doubt him,&rdquo; said Father Rocco, gently; &ldquo;and I will
      believe in him myself as firmly as you do. Let us suppose, my child, that
      you have learned patiently all the many things of which you are now
      ignorant, and which it is necessary for a lady to know. Let us suppose
      that Signor Fabio has really violated all the laws that govern people in
      his high station and has taken you to him publicly as his wife. You would
      be happy then, Nanina; but would he? He has no father or mother to control
      him, it is true; but he has friends&mdash;many friends and intimates in
      his own rank&mdash;proud, heartless people, who know nothing of your worth
      and goodness; who, hearing of your low birth, would look on you, and on
      your husband too, my child, with contempt. He has not your patience and
      fortitude. Think how bitter it would be for him to bear that contempt&mdash;to
      see you shunned by proud women, and carelessly pitied or patronized by
      insolent men. Yet all this, and more, he would have to endure, or else to
      quit the world he has lived in from his boyhood&mdash;the world he was
      born to live in. You love him, I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina&rsquo;s tears burst out afresh. &ldquo;Oh, how dearly&mdash;how dearly!&rdquo; she
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you love him dearly,&rdquo; continued the priest; &ldquo;but would all your love
      compensate him for everything else that he must lose? It might, at first;
      but there would come a time when the world would assert its influence over
      him again; when he would feel a want which you could not supply&mdash;a
      weariness which you could not solace. Think of his life then, and of
      yours. Think of the first day when the first secret doubt whether he had
      done rightly in marrying you would steal into his mind. We are not masters
      of all our impulses. The lightest spirits have their moments of
      irresistible depression; the bravest hearts are not always superior to
      doubt. My child, my child, the world is strong, the pride of rank is
      rooted deep, and the human will is frail at best! Be warned! For your own
      sake and for Fabio&rsquo;s, be warned in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina stretched out her hands toward the priest in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Father Rocco! Father Rocco!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;why did you not tell me this
      before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, my child, I only knew of the necessity for telling you to-day.
      But it is not too late; it is never too late to do a good action. You love
      Fabio, Nanina? Will you prove that love by making a great sacrifice for
      his good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would die for his good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you nobly cure him of a passion which will be his ruin, if not
      yours, by leaving Pisa to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave Pisa!&rdquo; exclaimed Nanina. Her face grew deadly pale; she rose and
      moved back a step or two from the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; pursued Father Rocco; &ldquo;I have heard you complain that you
      could not get regular employment at needle-work. You shall have that
      employment, if you will go with me&mdash;you and your little sister too,
      of course&mdash;to Florence to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised Fabio to go to the studio,&rdquo; began Nanina, affrightedly. &ldquo;I
      promised to go at ten o&rsquo;clock. How can I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped suddenly, as if her breath were failing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself will take you and your sister to Florence,&rdquo; said Father Rocco,
      without noticing the interruption. &ldquo;I will place you under the care of a
      lady who will be as kind as a mother to you both. I will answer for your
      getting such work to do as will enable you to keep yourself honestly and
      independently; and I will undertake, if you do not like your life at
      Florence, to bring you back to Pisa after a lapse of three months only.
      Three months, Nanina. It is not a long exile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fabio! Fabio!&rdquo; cried the girl, sinking again on the seat, and hiding her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for his good,&rdquo; said Father Rocco, calmly: &ldquo;for Fabio&rsquo;s good,
      remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would he think of me if I went away? Oh, if I had but learned to
      write! If I could only write Fabio a letter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not to be depended on to explain to him all that he ought to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I go away from him! Oh! Father Rocco, how can you ask me to go
      away from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask you to do nothing hastily. I will leave you till to-morrow
      morning to decide. At nine o&rsquo;clock I shall be in the street; and I will
      not even so much as enter this house, unless I know beforehand that you
      have resolved to follow my advice. Give me a sign from your window. If I
      see you wave your white mantilla out of it, I shall know that you have
      taken the noble resolution to save Fabio and to save yourself. I will say
      no more, my child; for, unless I am grievously mistaken in you, I have
      already said enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out, leaving her still weeping bitterly. Not far from the house,
      he met La Biondella and the dog on their way back. The little girl stopped
      to report to him the safe delivery of her dinner-mats; but he passed on
      quickly with a nod and a smile. His interview with Nanina had left some
      influence behind it, which unfitted him just then for the occupation of
      talking to a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly half an hour before nine o&rsquo;clock on the following morning, Father
      Rocco set forth for the street in which Nanina lived. On his way thither
      he overtook a dog walking lazily a few paces ahead in the roadway; and
      saw, at the same time, an elegantly-dressed lady advancing toward him. The
      dog stopped suspiciously as she approached, and growled and showed his
      teeth when she passed him. The lady, on her side, uttered an exclamation
      of disgust, but did not seem to be either astonished or frightened by the
      animal&rsquo;s threatening attitude. Father Rocco looked after her with some
      curiosity as she walked by him. She was a handsome woman, and he admired
      her courage. &ldquo;I know that growling brute well enough,&rdquo; he said to himself,
      &ldquo;but who can the lady be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog was Scarammuccia, returning from one of his marauding expeditions
      The lady was Brigida, on her way to Luca Lomi&rsquo;s studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes before nine o&rsquo;clock the priest took his post in the street,
      opposite Nanina&rsquo;s window. It was open; but neither she nor her little
      sister appeared at it. He looked up anxiously as the church-clocks struck
      the hour; but there was no sign for a minute or so after they were all
      silent. &ldquo;Is she hesitating still?&rdquo; said Father Rocco to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the words passed his lips, the white mantilla was waved out of the
      window.

      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Even the master-stroke of replacing the treacherous Italian forewoman by a
      French dressmaker, engaged direct from Paris, did not at first avail to
      elevate the great Grifoni establishment above the reach of minor
      calamities. Mademoiselle Virginie had not occupied her new situation at
      Pisa quite a week before she fell ill. All sorts of reports were
      circulated as to the cause of this illness; and the Demoiselle Grifoni
      even went so far as to suggest that the health of the new forewoman had
      fallen a sacrifice to some nefarious practices of the chemical sort, on
      the part of her rival in the trade. But, however the misfortune had been
      produced, it was a fact that Mademoiselle Virginie was certainly very ill,
      and another fact that the doctor insisted on her being sent to the baths
      of Lucca as soon as she could be moved from her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for the Demoiselle Grifoni, the Frenchwoman had succeeded in
      producing three specimens of her art before her health broke down. They
      comprised the evening-dress of yellow brocaded silk, to which she had
      devoted herself on the morning when she first assumed her duties at Pisa;
      a black cloak and hood of an entirely new shape; and an irresistibly
      fascinating dressing-gown, said to have been first brought into fashion by
      the princesses of the blood-royal of France. These articles of costume, on
      being exhibited in the showroom, electrified the ladies of Pisa; and
      orders from all sides flowed in immediately on the Grifoni establishment.
      They were, of course, easily executed by the inferior work-women, from the
      specimen designs of the French dressmaker. So that the illness of
      Mademoiselle Virginie, though it might cause her mistress some temporary
      inconvenience, was, after all, productive of no absolute loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months at the baths of Lucca restored the new forewoman to health. She
      returned to Pisa, and resumed her place in the private work-room. Once
      re-established there, she discovered that an important change had taken
      place during her absence. Her friend and assistant, Brigida, had resigned
      her situation. All inquiries made of the Demoiselle Grifoni only elicited
      one answer: the missing work-woman had abruptly left her place at five
      minutes&rsquo; warning, and had departed without confiding to any one what she
      thought of doing, or whither she intended to turn her steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Months elapsed The new year came; but no explanatory letter arrived from
      Brigida. The spring season passed off, with all its accompaniments of
      dressmaking and dress-buying, but still there was no news of her. The
      first anniversary of Mademoiselle Virginie&rsquo;s engagement with the
      Demoiselle Grifoni came round; and then at last a note arrived, stating
      that Brigida had returned to Pisa, and that if the French forewoman would
      send an answer, mentioning where her private lodgings were, she would
      visit her old friend that evening after business hours. The information
      was gladly enough given; and, punctually to the appointed time, Brigida
      arrived in Mademoiselle Virginie&rsquo;s little sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advancing with her usual indolent stateliness of gait, the Italian asked
      after her friend&rsquo;s health as coolly, and sat down in the nearest chair as
      carelessly, as if they had not been separated for more than a few days.
      Mademoiselle Virginie laughed in her liveliest manner, and raised her
      mobile French eyebrows in sprightly astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Brigida!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;they certainly did you no injustice when
      they nicknamed you &lsquo;Care-for-Nothing,&rsquo; in old Grifoni&rsquo;s workroom. Where
      have you been? Why have you never written to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had nothing particular to write about; and besides, I always intended
      to come back to Pisa and see you,&rdquo; answered Brigida, leaning back
      luxuriously in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where have you been for nearly a whole year past? In Italy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; at Paris. You know I can sing&mdash;not very well; but I have a
      voice, and most Frenchwomen (excuse the impertinence) have none. I met
      with a friend, and got introduced to a manager; and I have been singing at
      the theater&mdash;not the great parts, only the second. Your amiable
      countrywomen could not screech me down on the stage, but they intrigued
      against me successfully behind the scenes. In short, I quarreled with our
      principal lady, quarreled with the manager, quarreled with my friend; and
      here I am back at Pisa, with a little money saved in my pocket, and no
      great notion what I am to do next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back at Pisa? Why did you leave it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brigida&rsquo;s eyes began to lose their indolent expression. She sat up
      suddenly in her chair, and set one of her hands heavily on a little table
      by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Because when I find the game going against me, I
      prefer giving it up at once to waiting to be beaten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you refer to that last year&rsquo;s project of yours for making your
      fortune among the sculptors. I should like to hear how it was you failed
      with the wealthy young amateur. Remember that I fell ill before you had
      any news to give me. Your absence when I returned from Lucca, and, almost
      immediately afterward, the marriage of your intended conquest to the
      sculptor&rsquo;s daughter, proved to me, of course, that you must have failed.
      But I never heard how. I know nothing at this moment but the bare fact
      that Maddalena Lomi won the prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me first, do she and her husband live together happily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no stories of their disagreeing. She has dresses, horses,
      carriages; a negro page, the smallest lap-dog in Italy&mdash;in short, all
      the luxuries that a woman can want; and a child, by-the-by, into the
      bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; a child, born little more than a week ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a boy, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that. Those rich people always want the first-born to be an
      heir. They will both be disappointed. I am glad of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us, Brigida, how fierce you look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I? It&rsquo;s likely enough. I hate Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli and Maddalena Lomi&mdash;singly
      as man and woman, doubly as man and wife. Stop! I&rsquo;ll tell you what you
      want to know directly. Only answer me another question or two first. Have
      you heard anything about her health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I hear? Dressmakers can&rsquo;t inquire at the doors of the
      nobility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. Now one last question. That little simpleton, Nanina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen or heard anything of her. She can&rsquo;t be at Pisa, or she
      would have called at our place for work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I need not have asked about her if I had thought a moment beforehand.
      Father Rocco would be sure to keep her out of Fabio&rsquo;s sight, for his
      niece&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, he really loved that &lsquo;thread-paper of a girl&rsquo; as you called her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than fifty such wives as he has got now! I was in the studio the
      morning he was told of her departure from Pisa. A letter was privately
      given to him, telling him that the girl had left the place out of a
      feeling of honor, and had hidden herself beyond the possibility of
      discovery, to prevent him from compromising himself with all his friends
      by marrying her. Naturally enough, he would not believe that this was her
      own doing; and, naturally enough also, when Father Rocco was sent for, and
      was not to be found, he suspected the priest of being at the bottom of the
      business. I never saw a man in such a fury of despair and rage before. He
      swore that he would have all Italy searched for the girl, that he would be
      the death of the priest, and that he would never enter Luca Lomi&rsquo;s studio
      again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, as to this last particular, of course, being a man, he failed to
      keep his word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. At that first visit of mine to the studio I discovered two
      things. The first, as I said, that Fabio was really in love with the girl&mdash;the
      second, that Maddalena Lomi was really in love with him. You may suppose I
      looked at her attentively while the disturbance was going on, and while
      nobody&rsquo;s notice was directed on me. All women are vain, I know, but vanity
      never blinded my eyes. I saw directly that I had but one superiority over
      her&mdash;my figure. She was my height, but not well made. She had hair as
      dark and as glossy as mine; eyes as bright and as black as mine; and the
      rest of her face better than mine. My nose is coarse, my lips are too
      thick, and my upper lip overhangs my under too far. She had none of those
      personal faults; and, as for capacity, she managed the young fool in his
      passion as well as I could have managed him in her place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She stood silent, with downcast eyes and a distressed look, all the time
      he was raving up and down the studio. She must have hated the girl, and
      been rejoiced at her disappearance; but she never showed it. &lsquo;You would be
      an awkward rival&rsquo; (I thought to myself), &lsquo;even to a handsomer woman than I
      am.&rsquo; However, I determined not to despair too soon, and made up my mind to
      follow my plan just as if the accident of the girl&rsquo;s disappearance had
      never occurred. I smoothed down the master-sculptor easily enough&mdash;flattering
      him about his reputation, assuring him that the works of Luca Lomi had
      been the objects of my adoration since childhood, telling him that I had
      heard of his difficulty in finding a model to complete his Minerva from,
      and offering myself (if he thought me worthy) for the honor&mdash;laying
      great stress on that word&mdash;for the honor of sitting to him. I don&rsquo;t
      know whether he was altogether deceived by what I told him; but he was
      sharp enough to see that I really could be of use, and he accepted my
      offer with a profusion of compliments. We parted, having arranged that I
      was to give him a first sitting in a week&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why put it off so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To allow our young gentleman time to cool down and return to the studio,
      to be sure. What was the use of my being there while he was away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;I forgot. And how long was it before he came back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had allowed him more time than enough. When I had given my first
      sitting I saw him in the studio, and heard it was his second visit there
      since the day of the girl&rsquo;s disappearance. Those very violent men are
      always changeable and irresolute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had he made no attempt, then, to discover Nanina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! He had searched for her himself, and had set others searching
      for her, but to no purpose. Four days of perpetual disappointment had been
      enough to bring him to his senses. Luca Lomi had written him a
      peace-making letter, asking what harm he or his daughter had done, even
      supposing Father Rocco was to blame. Maddalena Lomi had met him in the
      street, and had looked resignedly away from him, as if she expected him to
      pass her. In short, they had awakened his sense of justice and his good
      nature (you see, I can impartially give him his due), and they had got him
      back. He was silent and sentimental enough at first, and shockingly sulky
      and savage with the priest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder Father Rocco ventured within his reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Rocco is not a man to be daunted or defeated by anybody, I can
      tell you. The same day on which Fabio came back to the studio, he returned
      to it. Beyond boldly declaring that he thought Nanina had done quite
      right, and had acted like a good and virtuous girl, he would say nothing
      about her or her disappearance. It was quite useless to ask him questions&mdash;he
      denied that any one had a right to put them. Threatening, entreating,
      flattering&mdash;all modes of appeal were thrown away on him. Ah, my dear!
      depend upon it, the cleverest and politest man in Pisa, the most dangerous
      to an enemy and the most delightful to a friend, is Father Rocco. The rest
      of them, when I began to play my cards a little too openly, behaved with
      brutal rudeness to me. Father Rocco, from first to last, treated me like a
      lady. Sincere or not, I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;he treated me like a lady when
      the others treated me like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there! don&rsquo;t get hot about it now. Tell me instead how you made
      your first approaches to the young gentleman whom you talk of so
      contemptuously as Fabio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it turned out, in the worst possible way. First, of course, I made
      sure of interesting him in me by telling him that I had known Nanina. So
      far it was all well enough. My next object was to persuade him that she
      could never have gone away if she had truly loved him alone; and that he
      must have had some fortunate rival in her own rank of life, to whom she
      had sacrificed him, after gratifying her vanity for a time by bringing a
      young nobleman to her feet. I had, as you will easily imagine, difficulty
      enough in making him take this view of Nanina&rsquo;s flight. His pride and his
      love for the girl were both concerned in refusing to admit the truth of my
      suggestion. At last I succeeded. I brought him to that state of ruffled
      vanity and fretful self-assertion in which it is easiest to work on a
      man&rsquo;s feelings&mdash;in which a man&rsquo;s own wounded pride makes the best
      pitfall to catch him in. I brought him, I say, to that state, and then <i>she</i>
      stepped in and profited by what I had done. Is it wonderful now that I
      rejoice in her disappointments&mdash;that I should be glad to hear any ill
      thing of her that any one could tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did she first get the advantage of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had found out, she would never have succeeded where I failed. All I
      know is, that she had more opportunities of seeing him than I, and that
      she used them cunningly enough even to deceive me. While I thought I was
      gaining ground with Fabio, I was actually losing it. My first suspicions
      were excited by a change in Luca Lomi&rsquo;s conduct toward me. He grew cold,
      neglectful&mdash;at last absolutely rude. I was resolved not to see this;
      but accident soon obliged me to open my eyes. One morning I heard Fabio
      and Maddalena talking of me when they imagined I had left the studio. I
      can&rsquo;t repeat their words, especially here. The blood flies into my head,
      and the cold catches me at the heart, when I only think of them. It will
      be enough if I tell you that he laughed at me, and that she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! not so loud. There are other people lodging in the house. Never
      mind about telling me what you heard; it only irritates you to no purpose.
      I can guess that they had discovered&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through her&mdash;remember, all through her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand. They had discovered a great deal more than you
      ever intended them to know, and all through her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for the priest, Virginie, I should have been openly insulted and
      driven from their doors. He had insisted on their behaving with decent
      civility toward me. They said that he was afraid of me, and laughed at the
      notion of his trying to make them afraid too. That was the last thing I
      heard. The fury I was in, and the necessity of keeping it down, almost
      suffocated me. I turned round to leave the place forever, when, who should
      I see, standing close behind me, but Father Rocco. He must have discovered
      in my face that I knew all, but he took no notice of it. He only asked, in
      his usual quiet, polite way, if I was looking for anything I had lost, and
      if he could help me. I managed to thank him, and to get to the door. He
      opened it for me respectfully, and bowed&mdash;he treated me like a lady
      to the last! It was evening when I left the studio in that way. The next
      morning I threw up my situation, and turned my back on Pisa. Now you know
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear of the marriage? or did you only assume from what you knew
      that it would take place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of it about six months ago. A man came to sing in the chorus at
      our theater who had been employed some time before at the grand concert
      given on the occasion of the marriage. But let us drop the subject now. I
      am in a fever already with talking of it. You are in a bad situation here,
      my dear; I declare your room is almost stifling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I open the other window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; let us go out and get a breath of air by the river-side. Come! take
      your hood and fan&mdash;it is getting dark&mdash;nobody will see us, and
      we can come back here, if you like, in half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Virginie acceded to her friend&rsquo;s wish rather reluctantly.
      They walked toward the river. The sun was down, and the sudden night of
      Italy was gathering fast. Although Brigida did not say another word on the
      subject of Fabio or his wife, she led the way to the bank of the Arno, on
      which the young nobleman&rsquo;s palace stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they got near the great door of entrance, a sedan-chair,
      approaching in the opposite direction, was set down before it; and a
      footman, after a moment&rsquo;s conference with a lady inside the chair,
      advanced to the porter&rsquo;s lodge in the courtyard. Leaving her friend to go
      on, Brigida slipped in after the servant by the open wicket, and concealed
      herself in the shadow cast by the great closed gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marchesa Melani, to inquire how the Countess d&rsquo;Ascoli and the infant
      are this evening,&rdquo; said the footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress has not changed at all for the better since the morning,&rdquo;
       answered the porter. &ldquo;The child is doing quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footman went back to the sedan-chair; then returned to the porter&rsquo;s
      lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marchesa desires me to ask if fresh medical advice has been sent
      for,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another doctor has arrived from Florence to-day,&rdquo; replied the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Virginie, missing her friend suddenly, turned back toward the
      palace to look after her, and was rather surprised to see Brigida slip out
      of the wicket-gate. There were two oil lamps burning on pillars outside
      the doorway, and their light glancing on the Italian&rsquo;s face, as she passed
      under them, showed that she was smiling.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the Marchesa Melani was making inquiries at the gate of the palace,
      Fabio was sitting alone in the apartment which his wife usually occupied
      when she was in health. It was her favorite room, and had been prettily
      decorated, by her own desire, with hangings in yellow satin and furniture
      of the same color. Fabio was now waiting in it, to hear the report of the
      doctors after their evening visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Maddalena Lomi had not been his first love, and although he had
      married her under circumstances which are generally and rightly considered
      to afford few chances of lasting happiness in wedded life, still they had
      lived together through the one year of their union tranquilly, if not
      fondly. She had molded herself wisely to his peculiar humors, had made the
      most of his easy disposition; and, when her quick temper had got the
      better of her, had seldom hesitated in her cooler moments to acknowledge
      that she had been wrong. She had been extravagant, it is true, and had
      irritated him by fits of unreasonable jealousy; but these were faults not
      to be thought of now. He could only remember that she was the mother of
      his child, and that she lay ill but two rooms away from him&mdash;dangerously
      ill, as the doctors had unwillingly confessed on that very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness was closing in upon him, and he took up the handbell to ring
      for lights. When the servant entered there was genuine sorrow in his face,
      genuine anxiety in his voice, as he inquired for news from the sick-room.
      The man only answered that his mistress was still asleep, and then
      withdrew, after first leaving a sealed letter on the table by his master&rsquo;s
      side. Fabio summoned him back into the room, and asked when the letter had
      arrived. He replied that it had been delivered at the palace two days
      since, and that he had observed it lying unopened on a desk in his
      master&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone again, Fabio remembered that the letter had arrived at a time
      when the first dangerous symptoms of his wife&rsquo;s illness had declared
      themselves, and that he had thrown it aside, after observing the address
      to be in a handwriting unknown to him. In his present state of suspense,
      any occupation was better than sitting idle. So he took up the letter with
      a sigh, broke the seal, and turned inquiringly to the name signed at the
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was &ldquo;NANINA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started, and changed color. &ldquo;A letter from her,&rdquo; he whispered to
      himself. &ldquo;Why does it come at such a time as this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face grew paler, and the letter trembled in his fingers. Those
      superstitious feelings which he had ascribed to the nursery influences of
      his childhood, when Father Rocco charged him with them in the studio,
      seemed to be overcoming him now. He hesitated, and listened anxiously in
      the direction of his wife&rsquo;s room, before reading the letter. Was its
      arrival ominous of good or evil? That was the thought in his heart as he
      drew the lamp near to him, and looked at the first lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I wrong in writing to you?&rdquo; (the letter began abruptly). &ldquo;If I am, you
      have but to throw this little leaf of paper into the fire, and to think no
      more of it after it is burned up and gone. I can never reproach you for
      treating my letter in that way; for we are never likely to meet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I go away? Only to save you from the consequences of marrying a
      poor girl who was not fit to become your wife. It almost broke my heart to
      leave you; for I had nothing to keep up my courage but the remembrance
      that I was going away for your sake. I had to think of that, morning and
      night&mdash;to think of it always, or I am afraid I should have faltered
      in my resolution, and have gone back to Pisa. I longed so much at first to
      see you once more, only to tell you that Nanina was not heartless and
      ungrateful, and that you might pity her and think kindly of her, though
      you might love her no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to tell you that! If I had been a lady I might have told it to you
      in a letter; but I had never learned to write, and I could not prevail on
      myself to get others to take the pen for me. All I could do was to learn
      secretly how to write with my own hand. It was long, long work; but the
      uppermost thought in my heart was always the thought of justifying myself
      to you, and that made me patient and persevering. I learned, at last, to
      write so as not to be ashamed of myself, or to make you ashamed of me. I
      began a letter&mdash;my first letter to you&mdash;but I heard of your
      marriage before it was done, and then I had to tear the paper up, and put
      the pen down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no right to come between you and your wife, even with so little a
      thing as a letter; I had no right to do anything but hope and pray for
      your happiness. Are you happy? I am sure you ought to be; for how can your
      wife help loving you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very hard for me to explain why I have ventured on writing now, and
      yet I can&rsquo;t think that I am doing wrong. I heard a few days ago (for I
      have a friend at Pisa who keeps me informed, by my own desire, of all the
      pleasant changes in your life)&mdash;I heard of your child being born; and
      I thought myself, after that, justified at last in writing to you. No
      letter from me, at such a time as this, can rob your child&rsquo;s mother of so
      much as a thought of yours that is due to her. Thus, at least, it seems to
      me. I wish so well to your child, that I cannot surely be doing wrong in
      writing these lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said already what I wanted to say&mdash;what I have been longing
      to say for a whole year past. I have told you why I left Pisa; and have,
      perhaps, persuaded you that I have gone through some suffering, and borne
      some heart-aches for your sake. Have I more to write? Only a word or two,
      to tell you that I am earning my bread, as I always wished to earn it,
      quietly at home&mdash;at least, at what I must call home now. I am living
      with reputable people, and I want for nothing. La Biondella has grown very
      much; she would hardly be obliged to get on your knee to kiss you now; and
      she can plait her dinner-mats faster and more neatly than ever. Our old
      dog is with us, and has learned two new tricks; but you can&rsquo;t be expected
      to remember him, although you were the only stranger I ever saw him take
      kindly to at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time I finished. If you have read this letter through to the end, I
      am sure you will excuse me if I have written it badly. There is no date to
      it, because I feel that it is safest and best for both of us that you
      should know nothing of where I am living. I bless you and pray for you,
      and bid you affectionately farewell. If you can think of me as a sister,
      think of me sometimes still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabio sighed bitterly while he read the letter. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he whispered to
      himself, &ldquo;why does it come at such a time as this, when I cannot dare not
      think of her?&rdquo; As he slowly folded the letter up the tears came into his
      eyes, and he half raised the paper to his lips. At the same moment, some
      one knocked at the door of the room. He started, and felt himself changing
      color guiltily as one of his servants entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress is awake,&rdquo; the man said, with a very grave face, and a very
      constrained manner; &ldquo;and the gentlemen in attendance desire me to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted, before he could give his message, by one of the
      medical men, who had followed him into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had better news to communicate,&rdquo; began the doctor, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is worse, then?&rdquo; said Fabio, sinking back into the chair from which
      he had risen the moment before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has awakened weaker instead of stronger after her sleep,&rdquo; returned
      the doctor, evasively. &ldquo;I never like to give up all hope till the very
      last, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is cruel not to be candid with him,&rdquo; interposed another voice&mdash;the
      voice of the doctor from Florence, who had just entered the room.
      &ldquo;Strengthen yourself to bear the worst,&rdquo; he continued, addressing himself
      to Fabio. &ldquo;She is dying. Can you compose yourself enough to go to her
      bedside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pale and speechless, Fabio rose from his chair, and made a sign in the
      affirmative. He trembled so that the doctor who had first spoken was
      obliged to lead him out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mistress has some near relations in Pisa, has she not?&rdquo; said the
      doctor from Florence, appealing to the servant who waited near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father, sir, Signor Luca Lomi; and her uncle, Father Rocco,&rdquo; answered
      the man. &ldquo;They were here all through the day, until my mistress fell
      asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where to find them now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Luca told me he should be at his studio, and Father Rocco said I
      might find him at his lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for them both directly. Stay, who is your mistress&rsquo;s confessor? He
      ought to be summoned without loss of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress&rsquo;s confessor is Father Rocco, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;send, or go yourself, at once. Even minutes may be of
      importance now.&rdquo; Saying this, the doctor turned away, and sat down to wait
      for any last demands on his services, in the chair which Fabio had just
      left.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before the servant could get to the priest&rsquo;s lodgings a visitor had
      applied there for admission, and had been immediately received by Father
      Rocco himself. This favored guest was a little man, very sprucely and
      neatly dressed, and oppressively polite in his manner. He bowed when he
      first sat down, he bowed when he answered the usual inquiries about his
      health, and he bowed, for the third time, when Father Rocco asked what had
      brought him from Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather an awkward business,&rdquo; replied the little man, recovering himself
      uneasily after his third bow. &ldquo;The dressmaker, named Nanina, whom you
      placed under my wife&rsquo;s protection about a year ago&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of her?&rdquo; inquired the priest eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to say she has left us, with her child-sister, and their very
      disagreeable dog, that growls at everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did they go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only yesterday. I came here at once to tell you, as you were so very
      particular in recommending us to take care of her. It is not our fault
      that she has gone. My wife was kindness itself to her, and I always
      treated her like a duchess. I bought dinner-mats of her sister; I even put
      up with the thieving and growling of the disagreeable dog&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have they gone to? Have you found out that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found out, by application at the passport-office, that they have
      not left Florence&mdash;but what particular part of the city they have
      removed to, I have not yet had time to discover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray why did they leave you, in the first place? Nanina is not a girl
      to do anything without a reason. She must have had some cause for going
      away. What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man hesitated, and made a fourth bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember your private instructions to my wife and myself, when you
      first brought Nanina to our house?&rdquo; he said, looking away rather uneasily
      while he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you were to watch her, but to take care that she did not suspect
      you. It was just possible, at that time, that she might try to get back to
      Pisa without my knowing it; and everything depended on her remaining at
      Florence. I think, now, that I did wrong to distrust her; but it was of
      the last importance to provide against all possibilities, and to abstain
      from putting too much faith in my own good opinion of the girl. For these
      reasons, I certainly did instruct you to watch her privately. So far you
      are quite right; and I have nothing to complain of. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; resumed the little man, &ldquo;that the first consequence of our
      following your instructions was a discovery (which we immediately
      communicated to you) that she was secretly learning to write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I also remember sending you word not to show that you knew what
      she was doing; but to wait and see if she turned her knowledge of writing
      to account, and took or sent any letters to the post. You informed me, in
      your regular monthly report, that she nearer did anything of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, until three days ago; and then she was traced from her room in my
      house to the post-office with a letter, which she dropped into the box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the address of which you discovered before she took it from your
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately I did not,&rdquo; answered the little man, reddening and looking
      askance at the priest, as if he expected to receive a severe reprimand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Father Rocco said nothing. He was thinking. Who could she have written
      to? If to Fabio, why should she have waited for months and months, after
      she had learned how to use her pen, before sending him a letter? If not to
      Fabio, to what other person could she have written?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret not discovering the address&mdash;regret it most deeply,&rdquo; said
      the little man, with a low bow of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late for regret,&rdquo; said Father Rocco, coldly. &ldquo;Tell me how she
      came to leave your house; I have not heard that yet. Be as brief as you
      can. I expect to be called every moment to the bedside of a near and dear
      relation, who is suffering from severe illness. You shall have all my
      attention; but you must ask it for as short a time as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be briefness itself. In the first place, you must know that I have&mdash;or
      rather had&mdash;an idle, unscrupulous rascal of an apprentice in my
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest pursed up his mouth contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the second place, this same good-for-nothing fellow had the
      impertinence to fall in love with Nanina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Rocco started, and listened eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must do the girl the justice to say that she never gave him the
      slightest encouragement; and that, whenever he ventured to speak to her,
      she always quietly but very decidedly repelled him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good girl!&rdquo; said Father Rocco. &ldquo;I always said she was a good girl. It
      was a mistake on my part ever to have distrusted her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the other offenses,&rdquo; continued the little man, &ldquo;of which I now find
      my scoundrel of an apprentice to have been guilty, was the enormity of
      picking the lock of my desk, and prying into my private papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought not to have had any. Private papers should always be burned
      papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall be for the future; I will take good care of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were any of my letters to you about Nanina among these private papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately they were. Pray, pray excuse my want of caution this time.
      It shall never happen again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on. Such imprudence as yours can never be excused; it can only be
      provided against for the future. I suppose the apprentice showed my
      letters to the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I infer as much; though why he should do so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simpleton! Did you not say that he was in love with her (as you term it),
      and that he got no encouragement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I said that&mdash;and I know it to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Was it not his interest, being unable to make any impression on the
      girl&rsquo;s fancy, to establish some claim to her gratitude; and try if he
      could not win her that way? By showing her my letters, he would make her
      indebted to him for knowing that she was watched in your house. But this
      is not the matter in question now. You say you infer that she had seen my
      letters. On what grounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the strength of this bit of paper,&rdquo; answered the little man, ruefully
      producing a note from his pocket. &ldquo;She must have had your letters shown to
      her soon after putting her own letter into the post. For, on the evening
      of the same day, when I went up into her room, I found that she and her
      sister and the disagreeable dog had all gone, and observed this note laid
      on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Rocco took the note, and read these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just discovered that I have been watched and suspected ever since
      my stay under your roof. It is impossible that I can remain another night
      in the house of a spy. I go with my sister. We owe you nothing, and we are
      free to live honestly where we please. If you see Father Rocco, tell him
      that I can forgive his distrust of me, but that I can never forget it. I,
      who had full faith in him, had a right to expect that he should have full
      faith in me. It was always an encouragement to me to think of him as a
      father and a friend. I have lost that encouragement forever&mdash;and it
      was the last I had left to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NANINA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest rose from his seat as he handed the note back, and the visitor
      immediately followed his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must remedy this misfortune as we best may,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh.
      &ldquo;Are you ready to go back to Florence to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find out where she is, and ascertain if she wants for anything, and if
      she is living in a safe place. Say nothing about me, and make no attempt
      to induce her to return to your house. Simply let me know what you
      discover. The poor child has a spirit that no ordinary people would
      suspect in her. She must be soothed and treated tenderly, and we shall
      manage her yet. No mistakes, mind, this time! Do just what I tell you, and
      do no more. Have you anything else to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, then,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said the little man, slipping through the door that was held
      open for him with the politest alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is vexatious,&rdquo; said Father Rocco, taking a turn or two in the study
      after his visitor had gone. &ldquo;It was bad to have done the child an
      injustice&mdash;it is worse to have been found out. There is nothing for
      it now but to wait till I know where she is. I like her, and I like that
      note she left behind her. It is bravely, delicately, and honestly written&mdash;a
      good girl&mdash;a very good girl, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the window, breathed the fresh air for a few moments, and
      quietly dismissed the subject from his mind. When he returned to his table
      he had no thoughts for any one but his sick niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems strange,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have had no message about her yet.
      Perhaps Luca has heard something. It may be well if I go to the studio at
      once to find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took up his hat and went to the door. Just as he opened it, Fabio&rsquo;s
      servant confronted him on the thresh old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sent to summon you to the palace,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;The doctors have
      given up all hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Rocco turned deadly pale, and drew back a step. &ldquo;Have you told my
      brother of this?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just on my way to the studio,&rdquo; answered the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go there instead of you, and break the bad news to him,&rdquo; said the
      priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They descended the stairs in silence. Just as they were about to separate
      at the street door, Father Rocco stopped the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the child?&rdquo; he asked, with such sudden eagerness and impatience,
      that the man looked quite startled as he answered that the child was
      perfectly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some consolation in that,&rdquo; said Father Rocco, walking away, and
      speaking partly to the servant, partly to himself. &ldquo;My caution has misled
      me,&rdquo; he continued, pausing thoughtfully when he was left alone in the
      roadway. &ldquo;I should have risked using the mother&rsquo;s influence sooner to
      procure the righteous restitution. All hope of compassing it now rests on
      the life of the child. Infant as she is, her father&rsquo;s ill-gotten wealth
      may yet be gathered back to the Church by her hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded rapidly on his way to the studio, until he reached the
      river-side and drew close to the bridge which it was necessary to cross in
      order to get to his brother&rsquo;s house. Here he stopped abruptly, as if
      struck by a sudden idea. The moon had just risen, and her light, streaming
      across the river, fell full upon his face as he stood by the parapet wall
      that led up to the bridge. He was so lost in thought that he did not hear
      the conversation of two ladies who were advancing along the pathway close
      behind him. As they brushed by him, the taller of the two turned round and
      looked back at his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Rocco!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Donna Brigida!&rdquo; cried the priest, looking surprised at first, but
      recovering himself directly and bowing with his usual quiet politeness.
      &ldquo;Pardon me if I thank you for honoring me by renewing our acquaintance,
      and then pass on to my brother&rsquo;s studio. A heavy affliction is likely to
      befall us, and I go to prepare him for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refer to the dangerous illness of your niece?&rdquo; said Brigida. &ldquo;I heard
      of it this evening. Let us hope that your fears are exaggerated, and that
      we may yet meet under less distressing circumstances. I have no present
      intention of leaving Pisa for some time, and I shall always be glad to
      thank Father Rocco for the politeness and consideration which he showed to
      me, under delicate circumstances, a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she courtesied deferentially, and moved away to rejoin
      her friend. The priest observed that Mademoiselle Virginie lingered rather
      near, as if anxious to catch a few words of the conversation between
      Brigida and himself. Seeing this, he, in his turn, listened as the two
      women slowly walked away together, and heard the Italian say to her
      companion: &ldquo;Virginie, I will lay you the price of a new dress that Fabio
      d&rsquo;Ascoli marries again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Rocco started when she said those words, as if he had trodden on
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My thought!&rdquo; he whispered nervously to himself. &ldquo;My thought at the moment
      when she spoke to me! Marry again? Another wife, over whom I should have
      no influence! Other children, whose education would not be confided to me!
      What would become, then, of the restitution that I have hoped for, wrought
      for, prayed for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and looked fixedly at the sky above him. The bridge was
      deserted. His black figure rose up erect, motionless, and spectral, with
      the white still light falling solemnly all around it. Standing so for some
      minutes, his first movement was to drop his hand angrily on the parapet of
      the bridge. He then turned round slowly in the direction by which the two
      women had walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Donna Brigida,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will lay you the price of fifty new dresses
      that Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli never marries again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He set his face once more toward the studio, and walked on without
      stopping until he arrived at the master-sculptor&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry again?&rdquo; he thought to himself, as he rang the bell. &ldquo;Donna Brigida,
      was your first failure not enough for you? Are you going to try a second
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luca Lomi himself opened the door. He drew Father Rocco hurriedly into the
      studio toward a single lamp burning on a stand near the partition between
      the two rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard anything of our poor child?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Tell me the truth!
      tell me the truth at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! compose yourself. I have heard,&rdquo; said Father Rocco, in low,
      mournful tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luca tightened his hold on the priest&rsquo;s arm, and looked into his face with
      breathless, speechless eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compose yourself,&rdquo; repeated Father Rocco. &ldquo;Compose yourself to hear the
      worst. My poor Luca, the doctors have given up all hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luca dropped his brother&rsquo;s arm with a groan of despair. &ldquo;Oh, Maddalena! my
      child&mdash;my only child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reiterating these words again and again, he leaned his head against the
      partition and burst into tears. Sordid and coarse as his nature was, he
      really loved his daughter. All the heart he had was in his statues and in
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first burst of his grief was exhausted, he was recalled to
      himself by a sensation as if some change had taken place in the lighting
      of the studio. He looked up directly, and dimly discerned the priest
      standing far down at the end of the room nearest the door, with the lamp
      in his hand, eagerly looking at something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rocco!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Rocco, why have you taken the lamp away? What are
      you doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no movement and no answer. Luca advanced a step or two, and
      called again. &ldquo;Rocco, what are you doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest heard this time, and came suddenly toward his brother, with the
      lamp in his hand&mdash;so suddenly that Luca started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, in astonishment. &ldquo;Gracious God, Rocco, how pale
      you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the priest never said a word. He put the lamp down on the nearest
      table. Luca observed that his hand shook. He had never seen his brother
      violently agitated before. When Rocco had announced, but a few minutes
      ago, that Maddalena&rsquo;s life was despaired of, it was in a voice which,
      though sorrowful, was perfectly calm. What was the meaning of this sudden
      panic&mdash;this strange, silent terror?
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest observed that his brother was looking at him earnestly. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
       he said in a faint whisper, &ldquo;come to her bedside: we have no time to lose.
      Get your hat, and leave it to me to put out the lamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurriedly extinguished the light while he spoke. They went down the
      studio side by side toward the door. The moonlight streamed through the
      window full on the place where the priest had been standing alone with the
      lamp in his hand. As they passed it, Luca felt his brother tremble, and
      saw him turn away his head.

      Two hours later, Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli and his wife were separated in this world
      forever; and the servants of the palace were anticipating in whispers the
      order of their mistress&rsquo;s funeral procession to the burial-ground of the
      Campo Santo.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      About eight months after the Countess d&rsquo;Ascoli had been laid in her grave
      in the Campo Santo, two reports were circulated through the gay world of
      Pisa, which excited curiosity and awakened expectation everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first report announced that a grand masked ball was to be given at the
      Melani Palace, to celebrate the day on which the heir of the house
      attained his majority. All the friends of the family were delighted at the
      prospect of this festival; for the old Marquis Melani had the reputation
      of being one of the most hospitable, and, at the same time, one of the
      most eccentric men in Pisa. Every one expected, therefore, that he would
      secure for the entertainment of his guests, if he really gave the ball,
      the most whimsical novelties in the way of masks, dances, and amusements
      generally, that had ever been seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second report was, that the rich widower, Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli, was on the
      point of returning to Pisa, after having improved his health and spirits
      by traveling in foreign countries; and that he might be expected to appear
      again in society, for the first time since the death of his wife, at the
      masked ball which was to be given in the Melani Palace. This announcement
      excited special interest among the young ladies of Pisa. Fabio had only
      reached his thirtieth year; and it was universally agreed that his return
      to society in his native city could indicate nothing more certainly than
      his desire to find a second mother for his infant child. All the single
      ladies would now have been ready to bet, as confidently as Brigida had
      offered to bet eight months before, that Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli would marry again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once in a way, report turned out to be true, in both the cases just
      mentioned. Invitations were actually issued from the Melani Palace, and
      Fabio returned from abroad to his home on the Arno.
    </p>
    <p>
      In settling all the arrangements connected with his masked ball, the
      Marquis Melani showed that he was determined not only to deserve, but to
      increase, his reputation for oddity. He invented the most extravagant
      disguises, to be worn by some of his more intimate friends; he arranged
      grotesque dances, to be performed at stated periods of the evening by
      professional buffoons, hired from Florence. He composed a toy symphony,
      which included solos on every noisy plaything at that time manufactured
      for children&rsquo;s use. And not content with thus avoiding the beaten track in
      preparing the entertainments at the ball, he determined also to show
      decided originality, even in selecting the attendants who were to wait on
      the company. Other people in his rank of life were accustomed to employ
      their own and hired footmen for this purpose; the marquis resolved that
      his attendants should be composed of young women only; that two of his
      rooms should be fitted up as Arcadian bowers; and that all the prettiest
      girls in Pisa should be placed in them to preside over the refreshments,
      dressed, in accordance with the mock classical taste of the period, as
      shepherdesses of the time of Virgil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only defect of this brilliantly new idea was the difficulty of
      executing it. The marquis had expressly ordered that not fewer than thirty
      shepherdesses were to be engaged&mdash;fifteen for each bower. It would
      have been easy to find double this number in Pisa, if beauty had been the
      only quality required in the attendant damsels. But it was also absolutely
      necessary, for the security of the marquis&rsquo;s gold and silver plate, that
      the shepherdesses should possess, besides good looks, the very homely
      recommendation of a fair character. This last qualification proved, it is
      sad to say, to be the one small merit which the majority of the ladies
      willing to accept engagements at the palace did not possess. Day after day
      passed on; and the marquis&rsquo;s steward only found more and more difficulty
      in obtaining the appointed number of trustworthy beauties. At last his
      resources failed him altogether; and he appeared in his master&rsquo;s presence
      about a week before the night of the ball, to make the humiliating
      acknowledgment that he was entirely at his wits&rsquo; end. The total number of
      fair shepherdesses with fair characters whom he had been able to engage
      amounted only to twenty-three.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried the marquis, irritably, as soon as the steward had made
      his confession. &ldquo;I told you to get thirty girls, and thirty I mean to
      have. What&rsquo;s the use of shaking your head when all their dresses are
      ordered? Thirty tunics, thirty wreaths, thirty pairs of sandals and silk
      stockings, thirty crooks, you scoundrel&mdash;and you have the impudence
      to offer me only twenty-three hands to hold them. Not a word! I won&rsquo;t hear
      a word! Get me my thirty girls, or lose your place.&rdquo; The marquis roared
      out this last terrible sentence at the top of his voice, and pointed
      peremptorily to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward knew his master too well to remonstrate. He took his hat and
      cane, and went out. It was useless to look through the ranks of rejected
      volunteers again; there was not the slightest hope in that quarter. The
      only chance left was to call on all his friends in Pisa who had daughters
      out at service, and to try what he could accomplish, by bribery and
      persuasion, that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a whole day occupied in solicitations, promises, and patient
      smoothing down of innumerable difficulties, the result of his efforts in
      the new direction was an accession of six more shepherdesses. This brought
      him on bravely from twenty-three to twenty-nine, and left him, at last,
      with only one anxiety&mdash;where was he now to find shepherdess number
      thirty?
    </p>
    <p>
      He mentally asked himself that important question, as he entered a shady
      by-street in the neighborhood of the Campo Santo, on his way back to the
      Melani Palace. Sauntering slowly along in the middle of the road, and
      fanning himself with his handkerchief after the oppressive exertions of
      the day, he passed a young girl who was standing at the street door of one
      of the houses, apparently waiting for somebody to join her before she
      entered the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Body of Bacchus!&rdquo; exclaimed the steward (using one of those old Pagan
      ejaculations which survive in Italy even to the present day), &ldquo;there
      stands the prettiest girl I have seen yet. If she would only be
      shepherdess number thirty, I should go home to supper with my mind at
      ease. I&rsquo;ll ask her, at any rate. Nothing can be lost by asking, and
      everything may be gained. Stop, my dear,&rdquo; he continued, seeing the girl
      turn to go into the house as he approached her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of me. I
      am steward to the Marquis Melani, and well known in Pisa as an eminently
      respectable man. I have something to say to you which may be greatly for
      your benefit. Don&rsquo;t look surprised; I am coming to the point at once. Do
      you want to earn a little money? honestly, of course. You don&rsquo;t look as if
      you were very rich, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very poor, and very much in want of some honest work to do,&rdquo;
       answered the girl, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall suit each other to a nicety; for I have work of the
      pleasantest kind to give you, and plenty of money to pay for it. But
      before we say anything more about that, suppose you tell me first
      something about yourself&mdash;who you are, and so forth. You know who I
      am already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only a poor work-girl, and my name is Nanina. I have nothing more,
      sir, to say about myself than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you belong to Pisa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;at least, I did. But I have been away for some time. I was
      a year at Florence, employed in needlework.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All by yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, with my little sister. I was waiting for her when you came up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never done anything else but needlework? never been out at
      service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. For the last eight months I have had a situation to wait on a
      lady at Florence, and my sister (who is turned eleven, sir, and can make
      herself very useful) was allowed to help in the nursery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came you to leave this situation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady and her family were going to Rome, sir. They would have taken me
      with them, but they could not take my sister. We are alone in the world,
      and we never have been parted from each other, and never shall be&mdash;so
      I was obliged to leave the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here you are, back at Pisa&mdash;with nothing to do, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing yet, sir. We only came back yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only yesterday! You are a lucky girl, let me tell you, to have met with
      me. I suppose you have somebody in the town who can speak to your
      character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The landlady of this house can, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is she, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marta Angrisani, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! the well-known sick-nurse? You could not possibly have a better
      recommendation, child. I remember her being employed at the Melani Palace
      at the time of the marquis&rsquo;s last attack of gout; but I never knew that
      she kept a lodging-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She and her daughter, sir, have owned this house longer than I can
      recollect. My sister and I have lived in it since I was quite a little
      child, and I had hoped we might be able to live here again. But the top
      room we used to have is taken, and the room to let lower down is far more,
      I am afraid, than we can afford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina mentioned the weekly rent of the room in fear and trembling. The
      steward burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I offered you money enough to be able to take that room for a
      whole year at once?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanina looked at him in speechless amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I offered you that?&rdquo; continued the steward. &ldquo;And suppose I only
      ask you in return to put on a fine dress and serve refreshments in a
      beautiful room to the company at the Marquis Melani&rsquo;s grand ball? What
      should you say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina said nothing. She drew back a step or two, and looked more
      bewildered than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have heard of the ball,&rdquo; said the steward, pompously; &ldquo;the
      poorest people in Pisa have heard of it. It is the talk of the whole
      city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Nanina made no answer. To have replied truthfully, she must have
      confessed that &ldquo;the talk of the whole city&rdquo; had now no interest for her.
      The last news from Pisa that had appealed to her sympathies was the news
      of the Countess d&rsquo;Ascoli&rsquo;s death, and of Fabio&rsquo;s departure to travel in
      foreign countries. Since then she had heard nothing more of him. She was
      as ignorant of his return to his native city as of all the reports
      connected with the marquis&rsquo;s ball. Something in her own heart&mdash;some
      feeling which she had neither the desire nor the capacity to analyze&mdash;had
      brought her back to Pisa and to the old home which now connected itself
      with her tenderest recollections. Believing that Fabio was still absent,
      she felt that no ill motive could now be attributed to her return; and she
      had not been able to resist the temptation of revisiting the scene that
      had been associated with the first great happiness as well as with the
      first great sorrow of her life. Among all the poor people of Pisa, she was
      perhaps the very last whose curiosity could be awakened, or whose
      attention could be attracted by the rumor of gayeties at the Melani
      Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she could not confess all this; she could only listen with great
      humility and no small surprise, while the steward, in compassion for her
      ignorance, and with the hope of tempting her into accepting his offered
      engagement, described the arrangements of the approaching festival, and
      dwelt fondly on the magnificence of the Arcadian bowers, and the beauty of
      the shepherdesses&rsquo; tunics. As soon as he had done, Nanina ventured on the
      confession that she should feel rather nervous in a grand dress that did
      not belong to her, and that she doubted very much her own capability of
      waiting properly on the great people at the ball. The steward, however,
      would hear of no objections, and called peremptorily for Marta Angrisani
      to make the necessary statement as to Nanina&rsquo;s character. While this
      formality was being complied with to the steward&rsquo;s perfect satisfaction,
      La Biondella came in, unaccompanied on this occasion by the usual
      companion of all her walks, the learned poodle Scarammuccia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Nanina&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; said the good-natured sick-nurse, taking the
      first opportunity of introducing La Biondella to the great marquis&rsquo;s great
      man. &ldquo;A very good, industrious little girl; and very clever at plaiting
      dinner-mats, in case his excellency should ever want any. What have you
      done with the dog, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get him past the pork butcher&rsquo;s, three streets off,&rdquo; replied
      La Biondella. &ldquo;He would sit down and look at the sausages. I am more than
      half afraid he means to steal some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very pretty child,&rdquo; said the steward, patting La Biondella on the
      cheek. &ldquo;We ought to have her at the hall. If his excellency should want a
      Cupid, or a youthful nymph, or anything small and light in that way, I
      shall come back and let you know. In the meantime, Nanina, consider
      yourself Shepherdess Number Thirty, and come to the housekeeper&rsquo;s room at
      the palace to try on your dress to-morrow. Nonsense! don&rsquo;t talk to me
      about being afraid and awkward. All you&rsquo;re wanted to do is to look pretty;
      and your glass must have told you you could do that long ago. Remember the
      rent of the room, my dear, and don&rsquo;t stand in your light and your
      sister&rsquo;s. Does the little girl like sweetmeats? Of course she does! Well,
      I promise you a whole box of sugar-plums to take home for her, if you will
      come and wait at the ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go to the ball, Nanina; go to the ball!&rdquo; cried La Biondella, clapping
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she will go to the ball,&rdquo; said the nurse. &ldquo;She would be mad to
      throw away such an excellent chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina looked perplexed. She hesitated a little, then drew Marta Angrisani
      away into a corner, and whispered this question to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think there will be any priests at the palace where the marquis
      lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, child, what a thing to ask!&rdquo; returned the nurse. &ldquo;Priests at a
      masked ball! You might as well expect to find Turks performing high mass
      in the cathedral. But supposing you did meet with priests at the palace,
      what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Nanina, constrainedly. She turned pale, and walked away as
      she spoke. Her great dread, in returning to Pisa, was the dread of meeting
      with Father Rocco again. She had never forgotten her first discovery at
      Florence of his distrust of her. The bare thought of seeing him any more,
      after her faith in him had been shaken forever, made her feel faint and
      sick at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; said the steward, putting on his
      hat, &ldquo;you will find your new dress all ready for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina courtesied, and ventured on no more objections. The prospect of
      securing a home for a whole year to come among people whom she knew,
      reconciled her&mdash;influenced as she was also by Marta Angrisani&rsquo;s
      advice, and by her sister&rsquo;s anxiety for the promised present&mdash;to
      brave the trial of appearing at the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a comfort to have it all settled at last,&rdquo; said the steward, as soon
      as he was out again in the street. &ldquo;We shall see what the marquis says
      now. If he doesn&rsquo;t apologize for calling me a scoundrel the moment he sets
      eyes on Number Thirty, he is the most ungrateful nobleman that ever
      existed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arriving in front of the palace, the steward found workmen engaged in
      planning the external decorations and illuminations for the night of the
      ball. A little crowd had already assembled to see the ladders raised and
      the scaffoldings put up. He observed among them, standing near the
      outskirts of the throng, a lady who attracted his attention (he was an
      ardent admirer of the fair sex) by the beauty and symmetry of her figure.
      While he lingered for a moment to look at her, a shaggy poodle-dog
      (licking his chops, as if he had just had something to eat) trotted by,
      stopped suddenly close to the lady, sniffed suspiciously for an instant,
      and then began to growl at her without the slightest apparent provocation.
      The steward advancing politely with his stick to drive the dog away, saw
      the lady start, and heard her exclaim to herself amazedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here, you beast! Can Nanina have come back to Pisa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last exclamation gave the steward, as a gallant man, an excuse for
      speaking to the elegant stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I heard you mention the name of Nanina.
      May I ask whether you mean a pretty little work-girl who lives near the
      Campo Santo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said the lady, looking very much surprised and interested
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be a gratification to you, madam, to know that she has just
      returned to Pisa,&rdquo; continued the steward, politely; &ldquo;and, moreover, that
      she is in a fair way to rise in the world. I have just engaged her to wait
      at the marquis&rsquo;s grand ball, and I need hardly say, under those
      circumstances, that if she plays her cards properly her fortune is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady bowed, looked at her informant very intently and thoughtfully for
      a moment, then suddenly walked away without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A curious woman,&rdquo; thought the steward, entering the palace. &ldquo;I must ask
      Number Thirty about her to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The death of Maddalena d&rsquo;Ascoli produced a complete change in the lives of
      her father and her uncle. After the first shock of the bereavement was
      over, Luca Lomi declared that it would be impossible for him to work in
      his studio again&mdash;for some time to come at least&mdash;after the
      death of the beloved daughter, with whom every corner of it was now so
      sadly and closely associated. He accordingly accepted an engagement to
      assist in restoring several newly discovered works of ancient sculpture at
      Naples, and set forth for that city, leaving the care of his work-rooms at
      Pisa entirely to his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the master-sculptor&rsquo;s departure, Father Rocco caused the statues and
      busts to be carefully enveloped in linen cloths, locked the studio doors,
      and, to the astonishment of all who knew of his former industry and
      dexterity as a sculptor, never approached the place again. His clerical
      duties he performed with the same assiduity as ever; but he went out less
      than had been his custom hitherto to the houses of his friends. His most
      regular visits were to the Ascoli Palace, to inquire at the porter&rsquo;s lodge
      after the health of Maddalena&rsquo;s child, who was always reported to be
      thriving admirably under the care of the best nurses that could be found
      in Pisa. As for any communications with his polite little friend from
      Florence, they had ceased months ago. The information&mdash;speedily
      conveyed to him&mdash;that Nanina was in the service of one of the most
      respectable ladies in the city seemed to relieve any anxieties which he
      might otherwise have felt on her account. He made no attempt to justify
      himself to her; and only required that his over-courteous little visitor
      of former days should let him know whenever the girl might happen to leave
      her new situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The admirers of Father Rocco, seeing the alteration in his life, and the
      increased quietness of his manner, said that, as he was growing older, he
      was getting more and more above the things of this world. His enemies (for
      even Father Rocco had them) did not scruple to assert that the change in
      him was decidedly for the worse, and that he belonged to the order of men
      who are most to be distrusted when they become most subdued. The priest
      himself paid no attention either to his eulogists or his depreciators.
      Nothing disturbed the regularity and discipline of his daily habits; and
      vigilant Scandal, though she sought often to surprise him, sought always
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Father Rocco&rsquo;s life from the period of his niece&rsquo;s death to
      Fabio&rsquo;s return to Pisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of course, the priest was one of the first to call at the
      palace and welcome the young nobleman back. What passed between them at
      this interview never was precisely known; but it was surmised readily
      enough that some misunderstanding had taken place, for Father Rocco did
      not repeat his visit. He made no complaints of Fabio, but simply stated
      that he had said something, intended for the young man&rsquo;s good, which had
      not been received in a right spirit; and that he thought it desirable to
      avoid the painful chance of any further collision by not presenting
      himself at the palace again for some little time. People were rather
      amazed at this. They would have been still more surprised if the subject
      of the masked ball had not just then occupied all their attention, and
      prevented their noticing it, by another strange event in connection with
      the priest. Father Rocco, some weeks after the cessation of his
      intercourse with Fabio, returned one morning to his old way of life as a
      sculptor, and opened the long-closed doors of his brother&rsquo;s studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luca Lomi&rsquo;s former workmen, discovering this, applied to him immediately
      for employment; but were informed that their services would not be needed.
      Visitors called at the studio, but were always sent away again by the
      disappointing announcement that there was nothing new to show them. So the
      days passed on until Nanina left her situation and returned to Pisa. This
      circumstance was duly reported to Father Rocco by his correspondent at
      Florence; but, whether he was too much occupied among the statues, or
      whether it was one result of his cautious resolution never to expose
      himself unnecessarily to so much as the breath of detraction, he made no
      attempt to see Nanina, or even to justify himself toward her by writing
      her a letter. All his mornings continued to be spent alone in the studio,
      and all his afternoons to be occupied by his clerical duties, until the
      day before the masked ball at the Melani Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on that day he covered over the statues, and locked the doors of the
      work-rooms once more; then returned to his own lodgings, and did not go
      out again. One or two of his friends who wanted to see him were informed
      that he was not well enough to be able to receive them. If they had
      penetrated into his little study, and had seen him, they would have been
      easily satisfied that this was no mere excuse. They would have noticed
      that his face was startlingly pale, and that the ordinary composure of his
      manner was singularly disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward evening this restlessness increased, and his old housekeeper, on
      pressing him to take some nourishment, was astonished to hear him answer
      her sharply and irritably, for the first time since she had been in his
      service. A little later her surprise was increased by his sending her with
      a note to the Ascoli Palace, and by the quick return of an answer, brought
      ceremoniously by one of Fabio&rsquo;s servants. &ldquo;It is long since he has had any
      communication with that quarter. Are they going to be friends again?&rdquo;
       thought the housekeeper as she took the answer upstairs to her master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel better to-night,&rdquo; he said as he read it; &ldquo;well enough indeed to
      venture out. If any one inquires for me, tell them that I am gone to the
      Ascoli Palace.&rdquo; Saying this, he walked to the door; then returned, and
      trying the lock of his cabinet, satisfied himself that it was properly
      secured; then went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Fabio in one of the large drawing-rooms of the palace, walking
      irritably backward and forward, with several little notes crumpled
      together in his hands, and a plain black domino dress for the masquerade
      of the ensuing night spread out on one of the tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going to write to you,&rdquo; said the young man, abruptly, &ldquo;when I
      received your letter. You offer me a renewal of our friendship, and I
      accept the offer. I have no doubt those references of yours, when we last
      met, to the subject of second marriages were well meant, but they
      irritated me; and, speaking under that irritation, I said words that I had
      better not have spoken. If I pained you, I am sorry for it. Wait! pardon
      me for one moment. I have not quite done yet. It seems that you are by no
      means the only person in Pisa to whom the question of my possibly marrying
      again appears to have presented itself. Ever since it was known that I
      intended to renew my intercourse with society at the ball to-morrow night,
      I have been persecuted by anonymous letters&mdash;infamous letters,
      written from some motive which it is impossible for me to understand. I
      want your advice on the best means of discovering the writers; and I have
      also a very important question to ask you. But read one of the letters
      first yourself; any one will do as a sample of the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fixing his eyes searchingly on the priest, he handed him one of the notes.
      Still a little paler than usual, Father Rocco sat down by the nearest
      lamp, and shading his eyes, read these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;COUNT FABIO&mdash;-It is the common talk of Pisa that you are likely, as
      a young man left with a motherless child, to marry again. Your having
      accepted an invitation to the Melani Palace gives a color of truth to this
      report. Widowers who are true to the departed do not go among all the
      handsomest single women in a city at a masked ball. Reconsider your
      determination, and remain at home. I know you, and I knew your wife, and I
      say to you solemnly, avoid temptation, for you must never marry again.
      Neglect my advice and you will repent it to the end of your life. I have
      reasons for what I say&mdash;serious, fatal reasons, which I cannot
      divulge. If you would let your wife lie easy in her grave, if you would
      avoid a terrible warning, go not to the masked ball!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you, and I ask any man, if that is not infamous?&rdquo; exclaimed Fabio,
      passionately, as the priest handed him back the letter. &ldquo;An attempt to
      work on my fears through the memory of my poor dead wife! An insolent
      assumption that I want to marry again, when I myself have not even so much
      as thought of the subject at all! What is the secret object of this
      letter, and of the rest here that resemble it? Whose interest is it to
      keep me away from the ball? What is the meaning of such a phrase as, &lsquo;If
      you would let your wife lie easy in her grave&rsquo;? Have you no advice to give
      me&mdash;no plan to propose for discovering the vile hand that traced
      these lines? Speak to me! Why, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest leaned his head on his hand, and, turning his face from the
      light as if it dazzled his eyes, replied in his lowest and quietest tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot speak till I have had time to think. The mystery of that letter
      is not to be solved in a moment. There are things in it that are enough to
      perplex and amaze any man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible for me to go into details&mdash;at least at the present
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak with a strange air of secrecy. Have you nothing definite to say&mdash;no
      advice to give me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should advise you not to go to the ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I gave you my reasons, I am afraid I should only be irritating you to
      no purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Rocco, neither your words nor your manner satisfy me. You speak in
      riddles; and you sit there in the dark with your face hidden from me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest instantly started up and turned his face to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recommend you to control your temper, and to treat me with common
      courtesy,&rdquo; he said, in his quietest, firmest tones, looking at Fabio
      steadily while he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not prolong this interview,&rdquo; said the young man, calming himself
      by an evident effort. &ldquo;I have one question to ask you, and then no more to
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest bowed his head, in token that he was ready to listen. He still
      stood up, calm, pale, and firm, in the full light of the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just possible,&rdquo; continued Fabio, &ldquo;that these letters may refer to
      some incautious words which my late wife might have spoken. I ask you as
      her spiritual director, and as a near relation who enjoyed her confidence,
      if you ever heard her express a wish, in the event of my surviving her,
      that I should abstain from marrying again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she never express such a wish to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. But why do you evade my question by asking me another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible for me to reply to your question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is impossible for me to give answers which must refer, whether
      they are affirmative or negative, to what I have heard in confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have spoken enough,&rdquo; said Fabio, turning angrily from the priest. &ldquo;I
      expected you to help me in clearing up these mysteries, and you do your
      best to thicken them. What your motives are, what your conduct means, it
      is impossible for me to know, but I say to you, what I would say in far
      other terms, if they were here, to the villains who have written these
      letters&mdash;no menaces, no mysteries, no conspiracies, will prevent me
      from being at the ball to-morrow. I can listen to persuasion, but I scorn
      threats. There lies my dress for the masquerade; no power on earth shall
      prevent me from wearing it to-morrow night!&rdquo; He pointed, as he spoke, to
      the black domino and half-mask lying on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No power on <i>earth!</i>&rdquo; repeated Father Rocco, with a smile, and an
      emphasis on the last word. &ldquo;Superstitious still, Count Fabio! Do you
      suspect the powers of the other world of interfering with mortals at
      masquerades?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabio started, and, turning from the table, fixed his eyes intently on the
      priest&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suggested just now that we had better not prolong this interview,&rdquo;
       said Father Rocco, still smiling. &ldquo;I think you were right; if we part at
      once, we may still part friends. You have had my advice not to go to the
      ball, and you decline following it. I have nothing more to say.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Fabio could utter the angry rejoinder that rose to his lips, the
      door of the room had opened and closed again, and the priest was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next night, at the time of assembling specified in the invitations to
      the masked ball, Fabio was still lingering in his palace, and still
      allowing the black domino to lie untouched and unheeded on his
      dressing-table. This delay was not produced by any change in his
      resolution to go to the Melani Palace. His determination to be present at
      the ball remained unshaken; and yet, at the last moment, he lingered and
      lingered on, without knowing why. Some strange influence seemed to be
      keeping him within the walls of his lonely home. It was as if the great,
      empty, silent palace had almost recovered on that night the charm which it
      had lost when its mistress died.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his own apartment and went to the bedroom where his infant child
      lay asleep in her little crib. He sat watching her, and thinking quietly
      and tenderly of many past events in his life for a long time, then
      returned to his room. A sudden sense of loneliness came upon him after his
      visit to the child&rsquo;s bedside; but he did not attempt to raise his spirits
      even then by going to the ball. He descended instead to his study, lighted
      his reading-lamp, and then, opening a bureau, took from one of the drawers
      in it the letter which Nanina had written to him. This was not the first
      time that a sudden sense of his solitude had connected itself inexplicably
      with the remembrance of the work-girl&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read it through slowly, and when he had done, kept it open in his hand.
      &ldquo;I have youth, titles, wealth,&rdquo; he thought to himself, sadly; &ldquo;everything
      that is sought after in this world. And yet if I try to think of any human
      being who really and truly loves me, I can remember but one&mdash;the
      poor, faithful girl who wrote these lines!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old recollections of the first day when he met with Nanina, of the first
      sitting she had given him in Luca Lomi&rsquo;s studio, of the first visit to the
      neat little room in the by-street, began to rise more and more vividly in
      his mind. Entirely absorbed by them, he sat absently drawing with pen and
      ink, on some sheets of letter-paper lying under his hand, lines and
      circles, and fragments of decorations, and vague remembrances of old ideas
      for statues, until the sudden sinking of the flame of his lamp awoke his
      attention abruptly to present things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch. It was close on midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      This discovery at last aroused him to the necessity of immediate
      departure. In a few minutes he had put on his domino and mask, and was on
      his way to the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he reached the Melani Palace the first part of the entertainment
      had come to an end. The &ldquo;Toy Symphony&rdquo; had been played, the grotesque
      dance performed, amid universal laughter; and now the guests were, for the
      most part, fortifying themselves in the Arcadian bowers for new dances, in
      which all persons present were expected to take part. The Marquis Melani
      had, with characteristic oddity, divided his two classical
      refreshment-rooms into what he termed the Light and Heavy Departments.
      Fruit, pastry, sweetmeats, salads, and harmless drinks were included under
      the first head, and all the stimulating liquors and solid eatables under
      the last. The thirty shepherdesses had been, according to the marquis&rsquo;s
      order, equally divided at the outset of the evening between the two rooms.
      But as the company began to crowd more and more resolutely in the
      direction of the Heavy Department, ten of the shepherdesses attached to
      the Light Department were told off to assist in attending on the hungry
      and thirsty majority of guests who were not to be appeased by pastry and
      lemonade. Among the five girls who were left behind in the room for the
      light refreshments was Nanina. The steward soon discovered that the
      novelty of her situation made her really nervous, and he wisely concluded
      that if he trusted her where the crowd was greatest and the noise loudest,
      she would not only be utterly useless, but also very much in the way of
      her more confident and experienced companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Fabio arrived at the palace, the jovial uproar in the Heavy
      Department was at its height, and several gentlemen, fired by the
      classical costumes of the shepherdesses, were beginning to speak Latin to
      them with a thick utterance, and a valorous contempt for all restrictions
      of gender, number, and case. As soon as he could escape from the
      congratulations on his return to his friends, which poured on him from all
      sides, Fabio withdrew to seek some quieter room. The heat, noise, and
      confusion had so bewildered him, after the tranquil life he had been
      leading for many months past, that it was quite a relief to stroll through
      the half deserted dancing-rooms, to the opposite extremity of the great
      suite of apartments, and there to find himself in a second Arcadian bower,
      which seemed peaceful enough to deserve its name.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few guests were in this room when he first entered it, but the distant
      sound of some first notes of dance music drew them all away. After a
      careless look at the quaint decorations about him, he sat down alone on a
      divan near the door, and beginning already to feel the heat and discomfort
      of his mask, took it off. He had not removed it more than a moment before
      he heard a faint cry in the direction of a long refreshment-table, behind
      which the five waiting-girls were standing. He started up directly, and
      could hardly believe his senses, when he found himself standing face to
      face with Nanina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks had turned perfectly colorless. Her astonishment at seeing the
      young nobleman appeared to have some sensation of terror mingled with it.
      The waiting-woman who happened to stand by her side instinctively
      stretched out an arm to support her, observing that she caught at the edge
      of the table as Fabio hurried round to get behind it and speak to her.
      When he drew near, her head drooped on her breast, and she said, faintly:
      &ldquo;I never knew you were at Pisa; I never thought you would be here. Oh, I
      am true to what I said in my letter, though I seem so false to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to you about the letter&mdash;to tell you how carefully I
      have kept it, how often I have read it,&rdquo; said Fabio.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away her head, and tried hard to repress the tears that would
      force their way into her eyes &ldquo;We should never have met,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;never, never have met again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Fabio could reply, the waiting-woman by Nanina&rsquo;s side interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t stop speaking to her here!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      impatiently. &ldquo;If the steward or one of the upper servants was to come in,
      you would get her into dreadful trouble. Wait till to-morrow, and find
      some fitter place than this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabio felt the justice of the reproof immediately. He tore a leaf out of
      his pocketbook, and wrote on it, &ldquo;I must tell you how I honor and thank
      you for that letter. To-morrow&mdash;ten o&rsquo;clock&mdash;the wicket-gate at
      the back of the Ascoli gardens. Believe in my truth and honor, Nanina, for
      I believe implicitly in yours.&rdquo; Having written these lines, he took from
      among his bunch of watch-seals a little key, wrapped it up in the note,
      and pressed it into her hand. In spite of himself his fingers lingered
      round hers, and he was on the point of speaking to her again, when he saw
      the waiting-woman&rsquo;s hand, which was just raised to motion him away,
      suddenly drop. Her color changed at the same moment, and she looked
      fixedly across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round immediately, and saw a masked woman standing alone in the
      room, dressed entirely in yellow from head to foot. She had a yellow hood,
      a yellow half-mask with deep fringe hanging down over her mouth, and a
      yellow domino, cut at the sleeves and edges into long flame-shaped points,
      which waved backward and forward tremulously in the light air wafted
      through the doorway. The woman&rsquo;s black eyes seemed to gleam with an evil
      brightness through the sight-holes of the mask, and the tawny fringe
      hanging before her mouth fluttered slowly with every breath she drew.
      Without a word or a gesture she stood before the table, and her gleaming
      black eyes fixed steadily on Fabio the instant he confronted her. A sudden
      chill struck through him, as he observed that the yellow of the stranger&rsquo;s
      domino and mask was of precisely the same shade as the yellow of the
      hangings and furniture which his wife had chosen after their marriage for
      the decoration of her favorite sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Yellow Mask!&rdquo; whispered the waiting-girls nervously, crowding
      together behind the table. &ldquo;The Yellow Mask again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make her speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask her to have something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman will ask her. Speak to her, sir. Do speak to her! She
      glides about in that fearful yellow dress like a ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabio looked around mechanically at the girl who was whispering to him. He
      saw at the same time that Nanina still kept her head turned away, and that
      she had her handkerchief at her eyes. She was evidently struggling yet
      with the agitation produced by their unexpected meeting, and was, most
      probably for that reason, the only person in the room not conscious of the
      presence of the Yellow Mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to her, sir. Do speak to her!&rdquo; whispered two of the waiting-girls
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabio turned again toward the table. The black eyes were still gleaming at
      him from behind the tawny yellow of the mask. He nodded to the girls who
      had just spoken, cast one farewell look at Nanina, and moved down the room
      to get round to the side of the table at which the Yellow Mask was
      standing. Step by step as he moved the bright eyes followed him. Steadily
      and more steadily their evil light seemed to shine through and through
      him, as he turned the corner of the table and approached the still,
      spectral figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came close up to the woman, but she never moved; her eyes never wavered
      for an instant. He stopped and tried to speak; but the chill struck
      through him again. An overpowering dread, an unutterable loathing seized
      on him; all sense of outer things&mdash;the whispering of the
      waiting-girls behind the table, the gentle cadence of the dance music, the
      distant hum of joyous talk&mdash;suddenly left him. He turned away
      shuddering, and quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the sound of the music, and desiring before all things now to
      join the crowd wherever it was largest, he was stopped in one of the
      smaller apartments by a gentleman who had just risen from the card table,
      and who held out his hand with the cordiality of an old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome back to the world, Count Fabio!&rdquo; he began, gayly, then suddenly
      checked himself. &ldquo;Why, you look pale, and your hand feels cold. Not ill, I
      hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I have been rather startled&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say why&mdash;by a very
      strangely dressed woman, who fairly stared me out of countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean the Yellow Mask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I do. Have you seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody has seen her; but nobody can make her unmask, or get her to
      speak. Our host has not the slightest notion who she is; and our hostess
      is horribly frightened at her. For my part, I think she has given us quite
      enough of her mystery and her grim dress; and if my name, instead of being
      nothing but plain Andrea D&rsquo;Arbino, was Marquis Melani, I would say to her:
      &lsquo;Madam, we are here to laugh and amuse ourselves; suppose you open your
      lips, and charm us by appearing in a prettier dress!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this conversation they had sat down together, with their backs
      toward the door, by the side of one of the card-tables. While D&rsquo;Arbino was
      speaking, Fabio suddenly felt himself shuddering again, and became
      conscious of a sound of low breathing behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round instantly, and there, standing between them, and peering
      down at them, was the Yellow Mask!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabio started up, and his friend followed his example. Again the gleaming
      black eyes rested steadily on the young nobleman&rsquo;s face, and again their
      look chilled him to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yellow Lady, do you know my friend?&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Arbino, with mock
      solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. The fatal eyes never moved from Fabio&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yellow Lady,&rdquo; continued the other, &ldquo;listen to the music. Will you dance
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes looked away, and the figure glided slowly from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear count,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arbino, &ldquo;that woman seems to have quite an effect
      on you. I declare she has left you paler than ever. Come into the
      supper-room with me, and have some wine; you really look as if you wanted
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went at once to the large refreshment-room. Nearly all the guests had
      by this time begun to dance again. They had the whole apartment,
      therefore, almost entirely to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the decorations of the room, which were not strictly in accordance
      with genuine Arcadian simplicity, was a large looking-glass, placed over a
      well-furnished sideboard. D&rsquo;Arbino led Fabio in this direction, exchanging
      greetings as he advanced with a gentleman who stood near the glass looking
      into it, and carelessly fanning himself with his mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Arbino, &ldquo;you are the very man to lead us
      straight to the best bottle of wine in the palace. Count Fabio, let me
      present to you my intimate and good friend, the Cavaliere Finello, with
      whose family I know you are well acquainted. Finello, the count is a
      little out of spirits, and I have prescribed a good dose of wine. I see a
      whole row of bottles at your side, and I leave it to you to apply the
      remedy. Glasses there! three glasses, my lovely shepherdess with the black
      eyes&mdash;the three largest you have got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glasses were brought; the Cavaliere Finello chose a particular bottle,
      and filled them. All three gentlemen turned round to the sideboard to use
      it as a table, and thus necessarily faced the looking-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us drink the toast of toasts,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arbino. &ldquo;Finello, Count
      Fabio&mdash;the ladies of Pisa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabio raised the wine to his lips, and was on the point of drinking it,
      when he saw reflected in the glass the figure of the Yellow Mask. The
      glittering eyes were again fixed on him, and the yellow-hooded head bowed
      slowly, as if in acknowledgment of the toast he was about to drink. For
      the third time the strange chill seized him, and he set down his glass of
      wine untasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Arbino.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any dislike, count, to that particular wine?&rdquo; inquired the
      cavaliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Yellow Mask!&rdquo; whispered Fabio. &ldquo;The Yellow Mask again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all three turned round directly toward the door. But it was too late&mdash;the
      figure had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does any one know who this Yellow Mask is?&rdquo; asked Finello. &ldquo;One may guess
      by the walk that the figure is a woman&rsquo;s. Perhaps it may be the strange
      color she has chosen for her dress, or perhaps her stealthy way of moving
      from room to room; but there is certainly something mysterious and
      startling about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Startling enough, as the count would tell you,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arbino. &ldquo;The
      Yellow Mask has been responsible for his loss of spirits and change of
      complexion, and now she has prevented him even from drinking his wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t account for it,&rdquo; said Fabio, looking round him uneasily; &ldquo;but
      this is the third room into which she has followed me&mdash;the third time
      she has seemed to fix her eyes on me alone. I suppose my nerves are hardly
      in a fit state yet for masked balls and adventures; the sight of her seems
      to chill me. Who can she be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she followed me a fourth time,&rdquo; said Finello, &ldquo;I should insist on her
      unmasking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose she refused?&rdquo; asked his friend
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should take her mask off for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible to do that with a woman,&rdquo; said Fabio. &ldquo;I prefer trying
      to lose her in the crowd. Excuse me, gentlemen, if I leave you to finish
      the wine, and then to meet me, if you like, in the great ballroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He retired as he spoke, put on his mask, and joined the dancers
      immediately, taking care to keep always in the most crowded corner of the
      apartment. For some time this plan of action proved successful, and he saw
      no more of the mysterious yellow domino. Ere long, however, some new
      dances were arranged, in which the great majority of the persons in the
      ballroom took part; the figures resembling the old English country dances
      in this respect, that the ladies and gentlemen were placed in long rows
      opposite to each other. The sets consisted of about twenty couples each,
      placed sometimes across, and sometimes along the apartment; and the
      spectators were all required to move away on either side, and range
      themselves close to the walls. As Fabio among others complied with this
      necessity, he looked down a row of dancers waiting during the performance
      of the orchestral prelude; and there, watching him again, from the
      opposite end of the lane formed by the gentlemen on one side and the
      ladies on the other, he saw the Yellow Mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved abruptly back, toward another row of dancers, placed at right
      angles to the first row; and there again; at the opposite end of the gay
      lane of brightly-dressed figures, was the Yellow Mask. He slipped into the
      middle of the room, but it was only to find her occupying his former
      position near the wall, and still, in spite of his disguise, watching him
      through row after row of dancers. The persecution began to grow
      intolerable; he felt a kind of angry curiosity mingling now with the vague
      dread that had hitherto oppressed him. Finello&rsquo;s advice recurred to his
      memory; and he determined to make the woman unmask at all hazards. With
      this intention he returned to the supper-room in which he had left his
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were gone, probably to the ballroom, to look for him. Plenty of wine
      was still left on the sideboard, and he poured himself out a glass.
      Finding that his hand trembled as he did so, he drank several more glasses
      in quick succession, to nerve himself for the approaching encounter with
      the Yellow Mask. While he was drinking he expected every moment to see her
      in the looking-glass again; but she never appeared&mdash;and yet he felt
      almost certain that he had detected her gliding out after him when he left
      the ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought it possible that she might be waiting for him in one of the
      smaller apartments, and, taking off his mask, walked through several of
      them without meeting her, until he came to the door of the
      refreshment-room in which Nanina and he had recognized each other. The
      waiting-woman behind the table, who had first spoken to him, caught sight
      of him now, and ran round to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in and speak to Nanina again,&rdquo; she said, mistaking the purpose
      which had brought him to the door. &ldquo;What with frightening her first, and
      making her cry afterward, you have rendered her quite unfit for her work.
      The steward is in there at this moment, very good-natured, but not very
      sober. He says she is pale and red-eyed, and not fit to be a shepherdess
      any longer, and that, as she will not be missed now, she may go home if
      she likes. We have got her an old cloak, and she is going to try and slip
      through the rooms unobserved, to get downstairs and change her dress.
      Don&rsquo;t speak to her, pray, or you will only make her cry again; and what is
      worse, make the steward fancy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped at that last word, and pointed suddenly over Fabio&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Yellow Mask!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, sir, draw her away into the
      ballroom, and give Nanina a chance of getting out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabio turned directly, and approached the Mask, who, as they looked at
      each other, slowly retreated before him. The waiting-woman, seeing the
      yellow figure retire, hastened back to Nanina in the refreshment-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the masked woman retreated from one apartment to another till she
      entered a corridor brilliantly lighted up and beautifully ornamented with
      flowers. On the right hand this corridor led to the ballroom; on the left
      to an ante-chamber at the head of the palace staircase. The Yellow Mask
      went on a few paces toward the left, then stopped. The bright eyes fixed
      themselves as before on Fabio&rsquo;s face, but only for a moment. He heard a
      light step behind him, and then he saw the eyes move. Following the
      direction they took, he turned round, and discovered Nanina, wrapped up in
      the old cloak which was to enable her to get downstairs unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how can I get out? how can I get out?&rdquo; cried the girl, shrinking back
      affrightedly as she saw the Yellow Mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That way,&rdquo; said Fabio, pointing in the direction of the ballroom. &ldquo;Nobody
      will notice you in the cloak; it will only be thought some new disguise.&rdquo;
       He took her arm as he spoke, to reassure her, and continued in a whisper,
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment he felt a hand laid on him. It was the hand of the
      masked woman, and it put him back from Nanina.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself, he trembled at her touch, but still retained presence
      of mind enough to sign to the girl to make her escape. With a look of
      eager inquiry in the direction of the mask, and a half suppressed
      exclamation of terror, she obeyed him, and hastened away toward the
      ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are alone,&rdquo; said Fabio, confronting the gleaming black eyes, and
      reaching out his hand resolutely toward the Yellow Mask. &ldquo;Tell me who you
      are, and why you follow me, or I will uncover your face, and solve the
      mystery for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman pushed his hand aside, and drew back a few paces, but never
      spoke a word. He followed her. There was not an instant to be lost, for
      just then the sound of footsteps hastily approaching the corridor became
      audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now or never,&rdquo; he whispered to himself, and snatched at the mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      His arm was again thrust aside; but this time the woman raised her
      disengaged hand at the same moment, and removed the yellow mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamps shed their soft light full on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the face of his dead wife.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Signor Andrea D&rsquo;Arbino, searching vainly through the various rooms in the
      palace for Count Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli, and trying as a last resource, the
      corridor leading to the ballroom and grand staircase, discovered his
      friend lying on the floor in a swoon, without any living creature near
      him. Determining to avoid alarming the guests, if possible, D&rsquo;Arbino first
      sought help in the antechamber. He found there the marquis&rsquo;s valet,
      assisting the Cavaliere Finello (who was just taking his departure) to put
      on his cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Finello and his friend carried Fabio to an open window in the
      antechamber, the valet procured some iced water. This simple remedy, and
      the change of atmosphere, proved enough to restore the fainting man to his
      senses, but hardly&mdash;as it seemed to his friends&mdash;to his former
      self. They noticed a change to blankness and stillness in his face, and
      when he spoke, an indescribable alteration in the tone of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found you in a room in the corridor,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arbino. &ldquo;What made you
      faint? Don&rsquo;t you remember? Was it the heat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabio waited for a moment, painfully collecting his ideas. He looked at
      the valet, and Finello signed to the man to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it the heat?&rdquo; repeated D&rsquo;Arbino.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Fabio, in strangely hushed, steady tones. &ldquo;I have seen the
      face that was behind the yellow mask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the face of my dead wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dead wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the mask was removed I saw her face. Not as I remember it in the
      pride of her youth and beauty&mdash;not even as I remember her on her
      sick-bed&mdash;but as I remember her in her coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count! for God&rsquo;s sake, rouse yourself! Collect your thoughts&mdash;remember
      where you are&mdash;and free your mind of its horrible delusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare me all remonstrances; I am not fit to bear them. My life has only
      one object now&mdash;the pursuing of this mystery to the end. Will you
      help me? I am scarcely fit to act for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still spoke in the same unnaturally hushed, deliberate tones. D&rsquo;Arbino
      and Finello exchanged glances behind him as he rose from the sofa on which
      he had hitherto been lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will help you in everything,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arbino, soothingly. &ldquo;Trust in us
      to the end. What do you wish to do first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The figure must have gone through this room. Let us descend the staircase
      and ask the servants if they have seen it pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Both D&rsquo;Arbino and Finello remarked that he did not say <i>her</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      They inquired down to the very courtyard. Not one of the servants had seen
      the Yellow Mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last resource was the porter at the outer gate. They applied to him;
      and in answer to their questions he asserted that he had most certainly
      seen a lady in a yellow domino and mask drive away, about half an hour
      before, in a hired coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you remember the coachman again?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Arbino.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly; he is an old friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know where he lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; as well as I know where I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any reward you like, if you can get somebody to mind your lodge, and can
      take us to that house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes they were following the porter through the dark, silent
      streets. &ldquo;We had better try the stables first,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;My friend,
      the coachman, will hardly have had time to do more than set the lady down.
      We shall most likely catch him just putting up his horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The porter turned out to be right. On entering the stable-yard, they found
      that the empty coach had just driven into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been taking home a lady in a yellow domino from the masquerade?&rdquo;
       said D&rsquo;Arbino, putting some money into the coachman&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I was engaged by that lady for the evening&mdash;engaged to
      drive her to the ball as well as to drive her home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you take her from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a very extraordinary place&mdash;from the gate of the Campo Santo
      burial-ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this colloquy, Finello and D&rsquo;Arbino had been standing with Fabio
      between them, each giving him an arm. The instant the last answer was
      given, he reeled back with a cry of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you taken her to now?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Arbino. He looked about him
      nervously as he put the question, and spoke for the first time in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Campo Santo again,&rdquo; said the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabio suddenly drew his arms out of the arms of his friends, and sank to
      his knees on the ground, hiding his face. From some broken ejaculations
      which escaped him, it seemed as if he dreaded that his senses were leaving
      him, and that he was praying to be preserved in his right mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is he so violently agitated?&rdquo; said Finello, eagerly, to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;You heard him say that when he saw the face
      behind the yellow mask, it was the face of his dead wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife was buried in the Campo Santo.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all the persons who had been present, in any capacity, at the Marquis
      Melani&rsquo;s ball, the earliest riser on the morning after it was Nanina. The
      agitation produced by the strange events in which she had been concerned
      destroyed the very idea of sleep. Through the hours of darkness she could
      not even close her eyes; and, as soon as the new day broke, she rose to
      breathe the early morning air at her window, and to think in perfect
      tranquillity over all that had passed since she entered the Melani Palace
      to wait on the guests at the masquerade.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching home the previous night, all her other sensations had been
      absorbed in a vague feeling of mingled dread and curiosity, produced by
      the sight of the weird figure in the yellow mask, which she had left
      standing alone with Fabio in the palace corridor. The morning light,
      however, suggested new thoughts. She now opened the note which the young
      nobleman had pressed into her hand, and read over and over again the
      hurried pencil lines scrawled on the paper. Could there be any harm, any
      forgetfulness of her own duty, in using the key inclosed in the note, and
      keeping her appointment in the Ascoli gardens at ten o&rsquo;clock? Surely not&mdash;surely
      the last sentence he had written, &ldquo;Believe in my truth and honor, Nanina,
      for I believe implicitly in yours,&rdquo; was enough to satisfy her this time
      that she could not be doing wrong in listening for once to the pleading of
      her own heart. And besides, there in her lap lay the key of the
      wicket-gate. It was absolutely necessary to use that, if only for the
      purpose of giving it back safely into the hand of its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this last thought was passing through her mind, and plausibly
      overcoming any faint doubts and difficulties which she might still have
      left, she was startled by a sudden knocking at the street door; and,
      looking out of the window immediately, saw a man in livery standing in the
      street, anxiously peering up at the house to see if his knocking had
      aroused anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Marta Angrisani, the sick-nurse, live here?&rdquo; inquired the man, as
      soon as Nanina showed herself at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Must I call her up? Is there some person ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call her up directly,&rdquo; said the servant; &ldquo;she is wanted at the Ascoli
      Palace. My master, Count Fabio&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina waited to hear no more. She flew to the room in which the
      sick-nurse slept, and awoke her, almost roughly, in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is ill!&rdquo; she cried, breathlessly. &ldquo;Oh, make haste, make haste! He is
      ill, and he has sent for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marta inquired who had sent for her, and on being informed, promised to
      lose no time. Nanina ran downstairs to tell the servant that the
      sick-nurse was getting on her clothes. The man&rsquo;s serious expression, when
      she came close to him, terrified her. All her usual self-distrust
      vanished; and she entreated him, without attempting to conceal her
      anxiety, to tell her particularly what his master&rsquo;s illness was, and how
      it had affected him so suddenly after the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about it,&rdquo; answered the man, noticing Nanina&rsquo;s manner as
      she put her question, with some surprise, &ldquo;except that my master was
      brought home by two gentlemen, friends of his, about a couple of hours
      ago, in a very sad state; half out of his mind, as it seemed to me. I
      gathered from what was said that he had got a dreadful shock from seeing
      some woman take off her mask, and show her face to him at the ball. How
      that could be I don&rsquo;t in the least understand; but I know that when the
      doctor was sent for, he looked very serious, and talked about fearing
      brain-fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the servant stopped; for, to his astonishment, he saw Nanina suddenly
      turn away from him, and then heard her crying bitterly as she went back
      into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marta Angrisani had huddled on her clothes and was looking at herself in
      the glass to see that she was sufficiently presentable to appear at the
      palace, when she felt two arms flung round her neck; and, before she could
      say a word, found Nanina sobbing on her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is ill&mdash;he is in danger!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;I must go with you to
      help him. You have always been kind to me, Marta&mdash;be kinder than ever
      now. Take me with you&mdash;take me with you to the palace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, child!&rdquo; exclaimed the nurse, gently unclasping her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes! if it is only for an hour,&rdquo; pleaded Nanina; &ldquo;if it is only
      for one little hour every day. You have only to say that I am your helper,
      and they would let me in. Marta! I shall break my heart if I can&rsquo;t see
      him, and help him to get well again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse still hesitated. Nanina clasped her round the neck once more,
      and laid her cheek&mdash;burning hot now, though the tears had been
      streaming down it but an instant before&mdash;close to the good woman&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love him, Marta; great as he is, I love him with all my heart and soul
      and strength,&rdquo; she went on, in quick, eager, whispering tones; &ldquo;and he
      loves me. He would have married me if I had not gone away to save him from
      it. I could keep my love for him a secret while he was well; I could
      stifle it, and crush it down, and wither it up by absence. But now he is
      ill, it gets beyond me; I can&rsquo;t master it. Oh, Marta! don&rsquo;t break my heart
      by denying me! I have suffered so much for his sake, that I have earned
      the right to nurse him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marta was not proof against this last appeal. She had one great and rare
      merit for a middle-aged woman&mdash;she had not forgotten her own youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, child,&rdquo; said she, soothingly; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t attempt to deny you. Dry
      your eyes, put on your mantilla; and, when we get face to face with the
      doctor, try to look as old and ugly as you can, if you want to be let into
      the sick-room along with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ordeal of medical scrutiny was passed more easily than Marta Angrisani
      had anticipated. It was of great importance, in the doctor&rsquo;s opinion, that
      the sick man should see familiar faces at his bedside. Nanina had only,
      therefore, to state that he knew her well, and that she had sat to him as
      a model in the days when he was learning the art of sculpture, to be
      immediately accepted as Marta&rsquo;s privileged assistant in the sick-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst apprehensions felt by the doctor for the patient were soon
      realized. The fever flew to his brain. For nearly six weeks he lay
      prostrate, at the mercy of death; now raging with the wild strength of
      delirium, and now sunk in the speechless, motionless, sleepless exhaustion
      which was his only repose. At last; the blessed day came when he enjoyed
      his first sleep, and when the doctor began, for the first time, to talk of
      the future with hope. Even then, however, the same terrible peculiarity
      marked his light dreams which had previously shown itself in his fierce
      delirium. From the faintly uttered, broken phrases which dropped from him
      when he slept, as from the wild words which burst from him when his senses
      were deranged, the one sad discovery inevitably resulted&mdash;that his
      mind was still haunted, day and night, hour after hour, by the figure in
      the yellow mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his bodily health improved, the doctor in attendance on him grew more
      and more anxious as to the state of his mind. There was no appearance of
      any positive derangement of intellect, but there was a mental depression&mdash;an
      unaltering, invincible prostration, produced by his absolute belief in the
      reality of the dreadful vision that he had seen at the masked ball&mdash;which
      suggested to the physician the gravest doubts about the case. He saw with
      dismay that the patient showed no anxiety, as he got stronger, except on
      one subject. He was eagerly desirous of seeing Nanina every day by his
      bedside; but, as soon as he was assured that his wish should be faithfully
      complied with, he seemed to care for nothing more. Even when they
      proposed, in the hope of rousing him to an exhibition of something like
      pleasure, that the girl should read to him for an hour every day out of
      one of his favorite books, he only showed a languid satisfaction. Weeks
      passed away, and still, do what they would, they could not make him so
      much as smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Nanina had begun to read to him as usual, but had not proceeded
      far before Marta Angrisani informed her that he had fallen into a doze.
      She ceased with a sigh, and sat looking at him sadly, as he lay near her,
      faint and pale and mournful in his sleep&mdash;miserably altered from what
      he was when she first knew him. It had been a hard trial to watch by his
      bedside in the terrible time of his delirium; but it was a harder trial
      still to look at him now, and to feel less and less hopeful with each
      succeeding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      While her eyes and thoughts were still compassionately fixed on him, the
      door of the bedroom opened, and the doctor came in, followed by Andrea
      D&rsquo;Arbino, whose share in the strange adventure with the Yellow Mask caused
      him to feel a special interest in Fabio&rsquo;s progress toward recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep, I see; and sighing in his sleep,&rdquo; said the doctor, going to the
      bedside. &ldquo;The grand difficulty with him,&rdquo; he continued, turning to
      D&rsquo;Arbino, &ldquo;remains precisely what it was. I have hardly left a single
      means untried of rousing him from that fatal depression; yet, for the last
      fortnight, he has not advanced a single step. It is impossible to shake
      his conviction of the reality of that face which he saw (or rather which
      he thinks he saw) when the yellow mask was removed; and, as long as he
      persists in his own shocking view of the case, so long he will lie there,
      getting better, no doubt, as to his body, but worse as to his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, poor fellow, he is not in a fit state to be reasoned with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, like all men with a fixed delusion, he has plenty of
      intelligence to appeal to on every point, except the one point on which he
      is wrong. I have argued with him vainly by the hour together. He
      possesses, unfortunately, an acute nervous sensibility and a vivid
      imagination; and besides, he has, as I suspect, been superstitiously
      brought up as a child. It would be probably useless to argue rationally
      with him on certain spiritual subjects, even if his mind was in perfect
      health. He has a good deal of the mystic and the dreamer in his
      composition; and science and logic are but broken reeds to depend upon
      with men of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he merely listen to you when you reason with him, or does he attempt
      to answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has only one form of answer, and that is, unfortunately, the most
      difficult of all to dispose of. Whenever I try to convince him of his
      delusion, he invariably retorts by asking me for a rational explanation of
      what happened to him at the masked ball. Now, neither you nor I, though we
      believe firmly that he has been the dupe of some infamous conspiracy, have
      been able as yet to penetrate thoroughly into this mystery of the Yellow
      Mask. Our common sense tells us that he must be wrong in taking his view
      of it, and that we must be right in taking ours; but if we cannot give him
      actual, tangible proof of that&mdash;if we can only theorize, when he asks
      us for an explanation&mdash;it is but too plain, in his present condition,
      that every time we remonstrate with him on the subject we only fix him in
      his delusion more and more firmly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not for want of perseverance on my part,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arbino, after a
      moment of silence, &ldquo;that we are still left in the dark. Ever since the
      extraordinary statement of the coachman who drove the woman home, I have
      been inquiring and investigating. I have offered the reward of two hundred
      scudi for the discovery of her; I have myself examined the servants at the
      palace, the night-watchman at the Campo Santo, the police-books, the lists
      of keepers of hotels and lodging-houses, to hit on some trace of this
      woman; and I have failed in all directions. If my poor friend&rsquo;s perfect
      recovery does indeed depend on his delusion being combated by actual
      proof, I fear we have but little chance of restoring him. So far as I am
      concerned, I confess myself at the end of my resources.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we are not quite conquered yet,&rdquo; returned the doctor. &ldquo;The proofs
      we want may turn up when we least expect them. It is certainly a miserable
      case,&rdquo; he continued, mechanically laying his fingers on the sleeping man&rsquo;s
      pulse. &ldquo;There he lies, wanting nothing now but to recover the natural
      elasticity of his mind; and here we stand at his bedside, unable to
      relieve him of the weight that is pressing his faculties down. I repeat
      it, Signor Andrea, nothing will rouse him from his delusion that he is the
      victim of a supernatural interposition but the production of some
      startling, practical proof of his error. At present he is in the position
      of a man who has been imprisoned from his birth in a dark room, and who
      denies the existence of daylight. If we cannot open the shutters and show
      him the sky outside, we shall never convert him to a knowledge of the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying these words, the doctor turned to lead the way out of the room, and
      observed Nanina, who had moved from the bedside on his entrance, standing
      near the door. He stopped to look at her, shook his head good-humoredly,
      and called to Marta, who happened to be occupied in an adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signora Marta,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I think you told me some time ago that
      your pretty and careful little assistant lives in your house. Pray, does
      she take much walking exercise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little, Signor Dottore. She goes home to her sister when she leaves
      the palace. Very little walking exercise, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so! Her pale cheeks and heavy eyes told me as much. Now, my
      dear,&rdquo; said the doctor, addressing Nanina, &ldquo;you are a very good girl, and
      I am sure you will attend to what I tell you. Go out every morning before
      you come here, and take a walk in the fresh air. You are too young not to
      suffer by being shut up in close rooms every day, unless you get some
      regular exercise. Take a good long walk in the morning, or you will fall
      into my hands as a patient, and be quite unfit to continue your attendance
      here. Now, Signor Andrea, I am ready for you. Mind, my child, a walk every
      day in the open air outside the town, or you will fall ill, take my word
      for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina promised compliance; but she spoke rather absently, and seemed
      scarcely conscious of the kind familiarity which marked the doctor&rsquo;s
      manner. The truth was, that all her thoughts were occupied with what he
      had been saying by Fabio&rsquo;s bedside. She had not lost one word of the
      conversation while the doctor was talking of his patient, and of the
      conditions on which his recovery depended. &ldquo;Oh, if that proof which would
      cure him could only be found!&rdquo; she thought to herself, as she stole back
      anxiously to the bedside when the room was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      On getting home that day she found a letter waiting for her, and was
      greatly surprised to see that it was written by no less a person than the
      master-sculptor, Luca Lomi. It was very short; simply informing her that
      he had just returned to Pisa, and that he was anxious to know when she
      could sit to him for a new bust&mdash;a commission from a rich foreigner
      at Naples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanina debated with herself for a moment whether she should answer the
      letter in the hardest way, to her, by writing, or, in the easiest way, in
      person; and decided on going to the studio and telling the master-sculptor
      that it would be impossible for her to serve him as a model, at least for
      some time to come. It would have taken her a long hour to say this with
      due propriety on paper; it would only take her a few minutes to say it
      with her own lips. So she put on her mantilla again and departed for the
      studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      On, arriving at the gate and ringing the bell, a thought suddenly occurred
      to her, which she wondered had not struck her before. Was it not possible
      that she might meet Father Rocco in his brother&rsquo;s work-room? It was too
      late to retreat now, but not too late to ask, before she entered, if the
      priest was in the studio. Accordingly, when one of the workmen opened the
      door to her, she inquired first, very confusedly and anxiously, for Father
      Rocco. Hearing that he was not with his brother then, she went tranquilly
      enough to make her apologies to the master-sculptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not think it necessary to tell him more than that she was now
      occupied every day by nursing duties in a sick-room, and that it was
      consequently out of her power to attend at the studio. Luca Lomi
      expressed, and evidently felt, great disappointment at her failing him as
      a model, and tried hard to persuade her that she might find time enough,
      if she chose, to sit to him, as well as to nurse the sick person. The more
      she resisted his arguments and entreaties, the more obstinately he
      reiterated them. He was dusting his favorite busts and statues, after his
      long absence, with a feather-brush when she came in; and he continued this
      occupation all the while he was talking&mdash;urging a fresh plea to
      induce Nanina to reconsider her refusal to sit at every fresh piece of
      sculpture he came to, and always receiving the same resolute apology from
      her as she slowly followed him down the studio toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving thus at the lower end of the room, Luca stopped with a fresh
      argument on his lips before his statue of Minerva. He had dusted it
      already, but he lovingly returned to dust it again. It was his favorite
      work&mdash;the only good likeness (although it did assume to represent a
      classical subject) of his dead daughter that he possessed. He had refused
      to part with it for Maddalena&rsquo;s sake; and, as he now approached it with
      his brush for the second time, he absently ceased speaking, and mounted on
      a stool to look at the face near and blow some specks of dust off the
      forehead. Nanina thought this a good opportunity of escaping from further
      importunities. She was on the point of slipping away to the door with a
      word of farewell, when a sudden exclamation from Luca Lomi arrested her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plaster!&rdquo; cried the master-sculptor, looking intently at that part of the
      hair of the statue which lay lowest on the forehead. &ldquo;Plaster here!&rdquo; He
      took out his penknife as he spoke, and removed a tiny morsel of some white
      substance from an interstice between two folds of the hair where it
      touched the face. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> plaster!&rdquo; he exclaimed, excitedly.
      &ldquo;Somebody has been taking a cast from the face of my statue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped off the stool, and looked all round the studio with an
      expression of suspicious inquiry. &ldquo;I must have this cleared up,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;My statues were left under Rocco&rsquo;s care, and he is answerable if there
      has been any stealing of casts from any one of them. I must question him
      directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina, seeing that he took no notice of her, felt that she might now
      easily effect her retreat. She opened the studio door, and repeated, for
      the twentieth time at least, that she was sorry she could not sit to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry too, child,&rdquo; he said, irritably looking about for his hat. He
      found it apparently just as Nanina was going out; for she heard him call
      to one of the workmen in the inner studio, and order the man to say, if
      anybody wanted him, that he had gone to Father Rocco&rsquo;s lodgings.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, when Nanina rose, a bad attack of headache, and a sense
      of languor and depression, reminded her of the necessity of following the
      doctor&rsquo;s advice, and preserving her health by getting a little fresh air
      and exercise. She had more than two hours to spare before the usual time
      when her daily attendance began at the Ascoli Palace; and she determined
      to employ the interval of leisure in taking a morning walk outside the
      town. La Biondella would have been glad enough to go too, but she had a
      large order for dinner-mats on hand, and was obliged, for that day, to
      stop in the house and work. Thus it happened that when Nanina set forth
      from home, the learned poodle, Scarammuccia, was her only companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the nearest way out of the town; the dog trotting along in his
      usual steady, observant way close at her side, pushing his great rough
      muzzle, from time to time, affectionately into her hand, and trying hard
      to attract her attention at intervals by barking and capering in front of
      her. He got but little notice, however, for his pains. Nanina was thinking
      again of all that the physician had said the day before by Fabio&rsquo;s
      bedside, and these thoughts brought with them others, equally absorbing,
      that were connected with the mysterious story of the young nobleman&rsquo;s
      adventure with the Yellow Mask. Thus preoccupied, she had little attention
      left for the gambols of the dog. Even the beauty of the morning appealed
      to her in vain. She felt the refreshment of the cool, fragrant air, but
      she hardly noticed the lovely blue of the sky, or the bright sunshine that
      gave a gayety and an interest to the commonest objects around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking nearly an hour, she began to feel tired, and looked about
      for a shady place to rest in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond and behind her there was only the high-road and the flat country;
      but by her side stood a little wooden building, half inn, half
      coffee-house, backed by a large, shady pleasure-garden, the gates of which
      stood invitingly open. Some workmen in the garden were putting up a stage
      for fireworks, but the place was otherwise quiet and lonely enough. It was
      only used at night as a sort of rustic Ranelagh, to which the citizens of
      Pisa resorted for pure air and amusement after the fatigues of the day.
      Observing that there were no visitors in the grounds, Nanina ventured in,
      intending to take a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s rest in the coolest place she
      could find before returning to Pisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had passed the back of a wooden summer-house in a secluded part of the
      gardens, when she suddenly missed the dog from her side; and, looking
      round after him, saw that he was standing behind the summer-house with his
      ears erect and his nose to the ground, having evidently that instant
      scented something that excited his suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking it possible that he might be meditating an attack on some
      unfortunate cat, she turned to see what he was watching. The carpenters
      engaged on the firework stage were just then hammering at it violently.
      The noise prevented her from hearing that Scarammuccia was growling, but
      she could feel that he was the moment she laid her hand on his back. Her
      curiosity was excited, and she stooped down close to him to look through a
      crack in the boards before which he stood into the summer-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was startled at seeing a lady and gentleman sitting inside. The place
      she was looking through was not high enough up to enable her to see their
      faces, but she recognized, or thought she recognized, the pattern of the
      lady&rsquo;s dress as one which she had noticed in former days in the Demoiselle
      Grifoni&rsquo;s show-room. Rising quickly, her eye detected a hole in the boards
      about the level of her own height, caused by a knot having been forced out
      of the wood. She looked through it to ascertain, without being discovered,
      if the wearer of the familiar dress was the person she had taken her to
      be; and saw, not Brigida only, as she had expected, but Father Rocco as
      well. At the same moment the carpenters left off hammering and began to
      saw. The new sound from the firework stage was regular and not loud. The
      voices of the occupants of the summer-house reached her through it, and
      she heard Brigida pronounce the name of Count Fabio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly stooping down once more by the dog&rsquo;s side, she caught his muzzle
      firmly in both her hands. It was the only way to keep Scarammuccia from
      growling again, at a time when there was no din of hammering to prevent
      him from being heard. Those two words, &ldquo;Count Fabio,&rdquo; in the mouth of
      another woman, excited a jealous anxiety in her. What could Brigida have
      to say in connection with that name? She never came near the Ascoli Palace&mdash;what
      right or reason could she have to talk of Fabio?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear what I said?&rdquo; she heard Brigida ask, in her coolest, hardest
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the priest answered. &ldquo;At least, not all of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will repeat it, then. I asked what had so suddenly determined you to
      give up all idea of making any future experiments on the superstitious
      fears of Count Fabio?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, the result of the experiment already tried has been
      so much more serious than I had anticipated, that I believe the end I had
      in view in making it has been answered already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; that is not your only reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another shock to his mind might be fatal to him. I can use what I believe
      to be a justifiable fraud to prevent his marrying again; but I cannot
      burden myself with a crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is your second reason; but I believe you have another yet. The
      suddenness with which you sent to me last night to appoint a meeting in
      this lonely place; the emphatic manner in which you requested&mdash;I may
      almost say ordered&mdash;me to bring the wax mask here, suggest to my mind
      that something must have happened. What is it? I am a woman, and my
      curiosity must be satisfied. After the secrets you have trusted to me
      already, you need not hesitate, I think, to trust me with one more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. The secret this time is, moreover, of no great importance.
      You know that the wax mask you wore at the ball was made in a plaster mold
      taken off the face of my brother&rsquo;s statue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother has just returned to his studio; has found a morsel of the
      plaster I used for the mold sticking in the hair of the statue; and has
      asked me, as the person left in charge of his work-rooms, for an
      explanation. Such an explanation as I could offer has not satisfied him,
      and he talks of making further inquiries. Considering that it will be used
      no more, I think it safest to destroy the wax mask, and I asked you to
      bring it here, that I might see it burned or broken up with my own eyes.
      Now you know all you wanted to know; and now, therefore, it is my turn to
      remind you that I have not yet had a direct answer to the first question I
      addressed to you when we met here. Have you brought the wax mask with you,
      or have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as that question was put, Nanina felt the dog dragging himself free
      of her grasp on his mouth. She had been listening hitherto with such
      painful intensity, with such all-absorbing emotions of suspense, terror,
      and astonishment, that she had not noticed his efforts to get away, and
      had continued mechanically to hold his mouth shut. But now she was aroused
      by the violence of his struggles to the knowledge that, unless she hit
      upon some new means of quieting him, he would have his mouth free, and
      would betray her by a growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an agony of apprehension lest she should lose a word of the momentous
      conversation, she made a desperate attempt to appeal to the dog&rsquo;s fondness
      for her, by suddenly flinging both her arms round his neck, and kissing
      his rough, hairy cheek. The stratagem succeeded. Scarammuccia had, for
      many years past, never received any greater marks of his mistress&rsquo;s
      kindness for him than such as a pat on the head or a present of a lump of
      sugar might convey. His dog&rsquo;s nature was utterly confounded by the
      unexpected warmth of Nanina&rsquo;s caress, and he struggled up vigorously in
      her arms to try and return it by licking her face. She could easily
      prevent him from doing this, and could so gain a few minutes more to
      listen behind the summer-house without danger of discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had lost Brigida&rsquo;s answer to Father Rocco&rsquo;s question; but she was in
      time to hear her next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are alone here,&rdquo; said Brigida. &ldquo;I am a woman, and I don&rsquo;t know that
      you may not have come armed. It is only the commonest precaution on my
      part not to give you a chance of getting at the wax mask till I have made
      my conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never said a word about conditions before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. I remember telling you that I wanted nothing but the novelty of
      going to the masquerade in the character of my dead enemy, and the luxury
      of being able to terrify the man who had brutally ridiculed me in old days
      in the studio. That was the truth. But it is not the less the truth that
      our experiment on Count Fabio has detained me in this city much longer
      than I ever intended, that I am all but penniless, and that I deserve to
      be paid. In plain words, will you buy the mask of me for two hundred
      scudi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not twenty scudi in the world, at my own free disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must find two hundred if you want the wax mask. I don&rsquo;t wish to
      threaten&mdash;but money I must have. I mention the sum of two hundred
      scudi, because that is the exact amount offered in the public handbills by
      Count Fabio&rsquo;s friends for the discovery of the woman who wore the yellow
      mask at the Marquis Melani&rsquo;s ball. What have I to do but to earn that
      money if I please, by going to the palace, taking the wax mask with me,
      and telling them that I am the woman. Suppose I confess in that way; they
      can do nothing to hurt me, and I should be two hundred scudi the richer.
      You might be injured, to be sure, if they insisted on knowing who made the
      wax model, and who suggested the ghastly disguise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch! do you believe that my character could be injured on the
      unsupported evidence of any words from your lips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Rocco, for the first time since I have enjoyed the pleasure of
      your acquaintance, I find you committing a breach of good manners. I shall
      leave you until you become more like yourself. If you wish to apologize
      for calling me a wretch, and if you want to secure the wax mask, honor me
      with a visit before four o&rsquo;clock this afternoon, and bring two hundred
      scudi with you. Delay till after four, and it will be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An instant of silence followed; and then Nanina judged that Brigida must
      be departing, for she heard the rustling of a dress on the lawn in front
      of the summer-house. Unfortunately, Scarammuccia heard it too. He twisted
      himself round in her arms and growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise disturbed Father Rocco. She heard him rise and leave the
      summer-house. There would have been time enough, perhaps, for her to
      conceal herself among some trees if she could have recovered her
      self-possession at once; but she was incapable of making an effort to
      regain it. She could neither think nor move&mdash;her breath seemed to die
      away on her lips&mdash;as she saw the shadow of the priest stealing over
      the grass slowly from the front to the back of the summer-house. In
      another moment they were face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped a few paces from her, and eyed her steadily in dead silence.
      She still crouched against the summer-house, and still with one hand
      mechanically kept her hold of the dog. It was well for the priest that she
      did so. Scarammuccia&rsquo;s formidable teeth were in full view, his shaggy coat
      was bristling, his eyes were starting, his growl had changed from the
      surly to the savage note; he was ready to tear down, not Father Rocco
      only, but all the clergy in Pisa, at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been listening,&rdquo; said the priest, calmly. &ldquo;I see it in your
      face. You have heard all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not answer a word; she could not take her eyes from him. There
      was an unnatural stillness in his face, a steady, unrepentant,
      unfathomable despair in his eyes that struck her with horror. She would
      have given worlds to be able to rise to her feet and fly from his
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I once distrusted you and watched you in secret,&rdquo; he said, speaking after
      a short silence, thoughtfully, and with a strange, tranquil sadness in his
      voice. &ldquo;And now, what I did by you, you do by me. You put the hope of your
      life once in my hands. Is it because they were not worthy of the trust
      that discovery and ruin overtake me, and that you are the instrument of
      the retribution? Can this be the decree of Heaven&mdash;or is it nothing
      but the blind justice of chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked upward, doubtingly, to the lustrous sky above him, and sighed.
      Nanina&rsquo;s eyes still followed his mechanically. He seemed to feel their
      influence, for he suddenly looked down at her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What keeps you silent? Why are you afraid?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can do you no
      harm, with your dog at your side, and the workmen yonder within call. I
      can do you no harm, and I wish to do you none. Go back to Pisa; tell what
      you have heard, restore the man you love to himself, and ruin me. That is
      your work; do it! I was never your enemy, even when I distrusted you. I am
      not your enemy now. It is no fault of yours that a fatality has been
      accomplished through you&mdash;no fault of yours that I am rejected as the
      instrument of securing a righteous restitution to the Church. Rise, child,
      and go your way, while I go mine, and prepare for what is to come. If we
      never meet again, remember that I parted from you without one hard saying
      or one harsh look&mdash;parted from you so, knowing that the first words
      you speak in Pisa will be death to my character, and destruction to the
      great purpose of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Speaking these words, always with the same calmness which had marked his
      manner from the first, he looked fixedly at her for a little while, sighed
      again, and turned away. Just before he disappeared among the trees, he
      said &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; but so softly that she could barely hear it. Some strange
      confusion clouded her mind as she lost sight of him. Had she injured him,
      or had he injured her? His words bewildered and oppressed her simple
      heart. Vague doubts and fears, and a sudden antipathy to remaining any
      longer near the summer-house, overcame her. She started to her feet, and,
      keeping the dog still at her side, hurried from the garden to the
      highroad. There, the wide glow of sunshine, the sight of the city lying
      before her, changed the current of her thoughts, and directed them all to
      Fabio and to the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burning impatience to be back in Pisa now possessed her. She hastened
      toward the city at her utmost speed. The doctor was reported to be in the
      palace when she passed the servants lounging in the courtyard. He saw the
      moment, she came into his presence, that something had happened, and led
      her away from the sick-room into Fabio&rsquo;s empty study. There she told him
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have saved him,&rdquo; said the doctor, joyfully. &ldquo;I will answer for his
      recovery. Only let that woman come here for the reward; and leave me to
      deal with her as she deserves. In the meantime, my dear, don&rsquo;t go away
      from the palace on any account until I give you permission. I am going to
      send a message immediately to Signor Andrea D&rsquo;Arbino to come and hear the
      extraordinary disclosure that you have made to me. Go back to read to the
      count, as usual, until I want you again; but, remember, you must not drop
      a word to him yet of what you have said to me. He must be carefully
      prepared for all that we have to tell him; and must be kept quite in the
      dark until those preparations are made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Arbino answered the doctor&rsquo;s summons in person; and Nanina repeated her
      story to him. He and the doctor remained closeted together for some time
      after she had concluded her narrative and had retired. A little before
      four o&rsquo;clock they sent for her again into the study. The doctor was
      sitting by the table with a bag of money before him, and D&rsquo;Arbino was
      telling one of the servants that if a lady called at the palace on the
      subject of the handbill which he had circulated, she was to be admitted
      into the study immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clock struck four Nanina was requested to take possession of a
      window-seat, and to wait there until she was summoned. When she had
      obeyed, the doctor loosened one of the window-curtains, to hide her from
      the view of any one entering the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a quarter of an hour elapsed, and then the door was thrown open, and
      Brigida herself was shown into the study. The doctor bowed, and D&rsquo;Arbino
      placed a chair for her. She was perfectly collected, and thanked them for
      their politeness with her best grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am addressing confidential friends of Count Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli?&rdquo;
       Brigida began. &ldquo;May I ask if you are authorized to act for the count, in
      relation to the reward which this handbill offers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, having examined the handbill, said that the lady was quite
      right, and pointed significantly to the bag of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are prepared, then,&rdquo; pursued Brigida, smiling, &ldquo;to give a reward of
      two hundred scudi to any one able to tell you who the woman is who wore
      the yellow mask at the Marquis Melani&rsquo;s ball, and how she contrived to
      personate the face and figure of the late Countess d&rsquo;Ascoli?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we are prepared,&rdquo; answered D&rsquo;Arbino, a little irritably. &ldquo;As
      men of honor, we are not in the habit of promising anything that we are
      not perfectly willing, under proper conditions, to perform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, my dear friend,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;I think you speak a little
      too warmly to the lady. She is quite right to take every precaution. We
      have the two hundred scudi here, madam,&rdquo; he continued, patting the
      money-bag; &ldquo;and we are prepared to pay that sum for the information we
      want. But&rdquo; (here the doctor suspiciously moved the bag of scudi from the
      table to his lap) &ldquo;we must have proofs that the person claiming the reward
      is really entitled to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brigida&rsquo;s eyes followed the money-bag greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proofs!&rdquo; she exclaimed, taking a small flat box from under her cloak, and
      pushing it across to the doctor. &ldquo;Proofs! there you will find one proof
      that establishes my claim beyond the possibility of doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor opened the box, and looked at the wax mask inside it; then
      handed it to D&rsquo;Arbino, and replaced the bag of scudi on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The contents of that box seem certainly to explain a great deal,&rdquo; he
      said, pushing the bag gently toward Brigida, but always keeping his hand
      over it. &ldquo;The woman who wore the yellow domino was, I presume, of the same
      height as the late countess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Brigida. &ldquo;Her eyes were also of the same color as the late
      countess&rsquo;s; she wore yellow of the same shade as the hangings in the late
      countess&rsquo;s room, and she had on, under her yellow mask, the colorless wax
      model of the late countess&rsquo;s face, now in your friend&rsquo;s hand. So much for
      that part of the secret. Nothing remains now to be cleared up but the
      mystery of who the lady was. Have the goodness, sir, to push that bag an
      inch or two nearer my way, and I shall be delighted to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, madam,&rdquo; said the doctor, with a very perceptible change in his
      manner. &ldquo;We know who the lady was already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved the bag of scudi while he spoke back to his own side of the
      table. Brigida&rsquo;s cheeks reddened, and she rose from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand, sir,&rdquo; she said, haughtily, &ldquo;that you take advantage
      of my position here, as a defenseless woman, to cheat me out of the
      reward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means, madam,&rdquo; rejoined the doctor. &ldquo;We have covenanted to pay the
      reward to the person who could give us the information we required.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir! have I not given you part of it? And am I not prepared to give
      you the whole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; but the misfortune is, that another person has been beforehand
      with you. We ascertained who the lady in the yellow domino was, and how
      she contrived to personate the face of the late Countess d&rsquo;Ascoli, several
      hours ago from another informant. That person has consequently the prior
      claim; and, on every principle of justice, that person must also have the
      reward. Nanina, this bag belongs to you&mdash;come and take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanina appeared from the window-seat. Brigida, thunderstruck, looked at
      her in silence for a moment; gasped out, &ldquo;That girl!&rdquo;&mdash;then stopped
      again, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl was at the back of the summer-house this morning, while you and
      your accomplice were talking together,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Arbino had been watching Brigida&rsquo;s face intently from the moment of
      Nanina&rsquo;s appearance, and had quietly stolen close to her side. This was a
      fortunate movement; for the doctor&rsquo;s last words were hardly out of his
      mouth before Brigida seized a heavy ruler lying, with some writing
      materials, on the table. In another instant, if D&rsquo;Arbino had not caught
      her arm, she would have hurled it at Nanina&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may let go your hold, sir,&rdquo; she said, dropping the ruler, and turning
      toward D&rsquo;Arbino with a smile on her white lips and a wicked calmness in
      her steady eyes. &ldquo;I can wait for a better opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With those words she walked to the door; and, turning round there,
      regarded Nanina fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had been a moment quicker with the ruler,&rdquo; she said, and went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor; &ldquo;I told you I knew how to deal with her as
      she deserved. One thing I am certainly obliged to her for&mdash;she has
      saved us the trouble of going to her house and forcing her to give up the
      mask. And now, my child,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Nanina, &ldquo;you can go
      home, and one of the men-servants shall see you safe to your own door, in
      case that woman should still be lurking about the palace. Stop! you are
      leaving the bag of scudi behind you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She</i> would have taken money!&rdquo; Saying those words, Nanina reddened,
      and looked toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor glanced approvingly at D&rsquo;Arbino. &ldquo;Well, well, we won&rsquo;t argue
      about that now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will lock up the money with the mask for
      to-day. Come here to-morrow morning as usual, my dear. By that time I
      shall have made up my mind on the right means for breaking your discovery
      to Count Fabio. Only let us proceed slowly and cautiously, and I answer
      for success.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, among the first visitors at the Ascoli Palace was the
      master-sculptor, Luca Lomi. He seemed, as the servants thought, agitated,
      and said he was especially desirous of seeing Count Fabio. On being
      informed that this was impossible, he reflected a little, and then
      inquired if the medical attendant of the count was at the palace, and
      could be spoken with. Both questions were answered in the affirmative, and
      he was ushered into the doctor&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not how to preface what I want to say,&rdquo; Luca began, looking about
      him confusedly. &ldquo;May I ask you, in the first place, if the work-girl named
      Nanina was here yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she speak in private with any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad at least to find that my object in wishing to see the count can
      be equally well answered by seeing you. My brother, I regret to say&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped perplexedly, and drew from his pocket a roll of papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may speak of your brother in the plainest terms,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I
      know what share he has had in promoting the infamous conspiracy of the
      Yellow Mask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My petition to you, and through you to the count, is, that your knowledge
      of what my brother has done may go no further. If this scandal becomes
      public it will ruin me in my profession. And I make little enough by it
      already,&rdquo; said Luca, with his old sordid smile breaking out again faintly
      on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do you come from your brother with this petition?&rdquo; inquired the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I come solely on my own account. My brother seems careless what
      happens. He has made a full statement of his share in the matter from the
      first; has forwarded it to his ecclesiastical superior (who will send it
      to the archbishop), and is now awaiting whatever sentence they choose to
      pass on him. I have a copy of the document, to prove that he has at least
      been candid, and that he does not shrink from consequences which he might
      have avoided by flight. The law cannot touch him, but the Church can&mdash;and
      to the Church he has confessed. All I ask is, that he may be spared a
      public exposure. Such an exposure would do no good to the count, and it
      would do dreadful injury to me. Look over the papers yourself, and show
      them, whenever you think proper, to the master of this house. I have every
      confidence in his honor and kindness, and in yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid the roll of papers open on the table, and then retired with great
      humility to the window. The doctor looked over them with some curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statement or confession began by boldly avowing the writer&rsquo;s
      conviction that part of the property which the Count Fabio d&rsquo;Ascoli had
      inherited from his ancestors had been obtained by fraud and
      misrepresentation from the Church. The various authorities on which this
      assertion was based were then produced in due order; along with some
      curious particles of evidence culled from old manuscripts, which it must
      have cost much trouble to collect and decipher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second section was devoted, at great length, to the reasons which
      induced the writer to think it his absolute duty, as an affectionate son
      and faithful servant of the Church, not to rest until he had restored to
      the successors of the apostles in his day the property which had been
      fraudulently taken from them in days gone by. The writer held himself
      justified, in the last resort, and in that only, in using any means for
      effecting this restoration, except such as might involve him in mortal
      sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third section described the priest&rsquo;s share in promoting the marriage
      of Maddalena Lomi with Fabio; and the hopes he entertained of securing the
      restitution of the Church property through his influence over his niece,
      in the first place, and, when she had died, through his influence over her
      child, in the second. The necessary failure of all his projects, if Fabio
      married again, was next glanced at; and the time at which the first
      suspicion of the possible occurrence of this catastrophe occurred to his
      mind was noted with scrupulous accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth section narrated the manner in which the conspiracy of the
      Yellow Mask had originated. The writer described himself as being in his
      brother&rsquo;s studio on the night of his niece&rsquo;s death, harassed by
      forebodings of the likelihood of Fabio&rsquo;s marrying again, and filled with
      the resolution to prevent any such disastrous second union at all hazards.
      He asserted that the idea of taking the wax mask from his brother&rsquo;s statue
      flashed upon him on a sudden, and that he knew of nothing to lead to it,
      except, perhaps, that he had been thinking just before of the
      superstitious nature of the young man&rsquo;s character, as he had himself
      observed it in the studio. He further declared that the idea of the wax
      mask terrified him at first; that he strove against it as against a
      temptation of the devil; that, from fear of yielding to this temptation,
      he abstained even from entering the studio during his brother&rsquo;s absence at
      Naples, and that he first faltered in his good resolution when Fabio
      returned to Pisa, and when it was rumored, not only that the young
      nobleman was going to the ball, but that he would certainly marry for the
      second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth section related that the writer, upon this, yielded to
      temptation rather than forego the cherished purpose of his life by
      allowing Fabio a chance of marrying again&mdash;that he made the wax mask
      in a plaster mold taken from the face of his brother&rsquo;s statue&mdash;and
      that he then had two separate interviews with a woman named Brigida (of
      whom he had some previous knowledge ), who was ready and anxious, from
      motives of private malice, to personate the deceased countess at the
      masquerade. This woman had suggested that some anonymous letters to Fabio
      would pave the way in his mind for the approaching impersonation, and had
      written the letters herself. However, even when all the preparations were
      made, the writer declared that he shrank from proceeding to extremities;
      and that he would have abandoned the whole project but for the woman
      Brigida informing him one day that a work-girl named Nanina was to be one
      of the attendants at the ball. He knew the count to have been in love with
      this girl, even to the point of wishing to marry her; he suspected that
      her engagement to wait at the ball was preconcerted; and, in consequence,
      he authorized his female accomplice to perform her part in the conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sixth section detailed the proceedings at the masquerade, and
      contained the writer&rsquo;s confession that, on the night before it, he had
      written to the count proposing the reconciliation of a difference that had
      taken place between them, solely for the purpose of guarding himself
      against suspicion. He next acknowledged that he had borrowed the key of
      the Campo Santo gate, keeping the authority to whom it was intrusted in
      perfect ignorance of the purpose for which he wanted it. That purpose was
      to carry out the ghastly delusion of the wax mask (in the very probable
      event of the wearer being followed and inquired after) by having the woman
      Brigida taken up and set down at the gate of the cemetery in which Fabio&rsquo;s
      wife had been buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seventh section solemnly averred that the sole object of the
      conspiracy was to prevent the young nobleman from marrying again, by
      working on his superstitious fears; the writer repeating, after this
      avowal, that any such second marriage would necessarily destroy his
      project for promoting the ultimate restoration of the Church possessions,
      by diverting Count Fabio&rsquo;s property, in great part, from his first wife&rsquo;s
      child, over whom the priest would always have influence, to another wife
      and probably other children, over whom he could hope to have none.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eighth and last section expressed the writer&rsquo;s contrition for having
      allowed his zeal for the Church to mislead him into actions liable to
      bring scandal on his cloth; reiterated in the strongest language his
      conviction that, whatever might be thought of the means employed, the end
      he had proposed to himself was a most righteous one; and concluded by
      asserting his resolution to suffer with humility any penalties, however
      severe, which his ecclesiastical superiors might think fit to inflict on
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having looked over this extraordinary statement, the doctor addressed
      himself again to Luca Lomi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that no useful end is to be gained now by
      mentioning your brother&rsquo;s conduct in public&mdash;always provided,
      however, that his ecclesiastical superiors do their duty. I shall show
      these papers to the count as soon as he is fit to peruse them, and I have
      no doubt that he will be ready to take my view of the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This assurance relieved Luca Lomi of a great weight of anxiety. He bowed
      and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor placed the papers in the same cabinet in which he had secured
      the wax mask. Before he locked the doors again he took out the flat box,
      opened it, and looked thoughtfully for a few minutes at the mask inside,
      then sent for Nanina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my child,&rdquo; he said, when she appeared, &ldquo;I am going to try our first
      experiment with Count Fabio; and I think it of great importance that you
      should be present while I speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took up the box with the mask in it, and beckoning to Nanina to follow
      him, led the way to Fabio&rsquo;s chamber.

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      About six months after the events already related, Signor Andrea D&rsquo;Arbino
      and the Cavaliere Finello happened to be staying with a friend, in a
      seaside villa on the Castellamare shore of the bay of Naples. Most of
      their time was pleasantly occupied on the sea, in fishing and sailing. A
      boat was placed entirely at their disposal. Sometimes they loitered whole
      days along the shore; sometimes made trips to the lovely islands in the
      bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening they were sailing near Sorrento, with a light wind. The beauty
      of the coast tempted them to keep the boat close inshore. A short time
      before sunset, they rounded the most picturesque headland they had yet
      passed; and a little bay, with a white-sand beach, opened on their view.
      They noticed first a villa surrounded by orange and olive trees on the
      rocky heights inland; then a path in the cliff-side leading down to the
      sands; then a little family party on the beach, enjoying the fragrant
      evening air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elders of the group were a lady and gentleman, sitting together on the
      sand. The lady had a guitar in her lap and was playing a simple dance
      melody. Close at her side a young child was rolling on the beach in high
      glee; in front of her a little girl was dancing to the music, with a very
      extraordinary partner in the shape of a dog, who was capering on his hind
      legs in the most grotesque manner. The merry laughter of the girl, and the
      lively notes of the guitar were heard distinctly across the still water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edge a little nearer in shore,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arbino to his friend, who was
      steering; &ldquo;and keep as I do in the shadow of the sail. I want to see the
      faces of those persons on the beach without being seen by them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finello obeyed. After approaching just near enough to see the countenances
      of the party on shore, and to be barked at lustily by the dog, they turned
      the boat&rsquo;s head again toward the offing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pleasant voyage, gentlemen,&rdquo; cried the clear voice of the little girl.
      They waved their hats in return; and then saw her run to the dog and take
      him by the forelegs. &ldquo;Play, Nanina,&rdquo; they heard her say. &ldquo;I have not half
      done with my partner yet.&rdquo; The guitar sounded once more, and the grotesque
      dog was on his hind legs in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had heard that he was well again, that he had married her lately, and
      that he was away with her and her sister, and his child by the first
      wife,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arbino; &ldquo;but I had no suspicion that their place of
      retirement was so near us. It is too soon to break in upon their
      happiness, or I should have felt inclined to run the boat on shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard the end of that strange adventure of the Yellow Mask,&rdquo; said
      Finello. &ldquo;There was a priest mixed up in it, was there not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but nobody seems to know exactly what has become of him. He was sent
      for to Rome, and has never been heard of since. One report is, that he has
      been condemned to some mysterious penal seclusion by his ecclesiastical
      superiors&mdash;another, that he has volunteered, as a sort of Forlorn
      Hope, to accept a colonial curacy among rough people, and in a
      pestilential climate. I asked his brother, the sculptor, about him a
      little while ago, but he only shook his head, and said nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the woman who wore the yellow mask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She, too, has ended mysteriously. At Pisa she was obliged to sell off
      everything she possessed to pay her debts. Some friends of hers at a
      milliner&rsquo;s shop, to whom she applied for help, would have nothing to do
      with her. She left the city, alone and penniless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat had approached the next headland on the coast while they were
      talking. They looked back for a last glance at the beach. Still the notes
      of the guitar came gently across the quiet water; but there mingled with
      them now the sound of the lady&rsquo;s voice. She was singing. The little girl
      and the dog were at her feet, and the gentleman was still in his old place
      close at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes more the boat rounded the next headland, the beach
      vanished from view, and the music died away softly in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      LAST LEAVES FROM LEAH&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </p>
    <p>
      3d of June.&mdash;Our stories are ended; our pleasant work is done. It is
      a lovely summer afternoon. The great hall at the farmhouse, after having
      been filled with people, is now quite deserted. I sit alone at my little
      work-table, with rather a crying sensation at my heart, and with the pen
      trembling in my fingers, as if I was an old woman already. Our manuscript
      has been sealed up and taken away; the one precious object of all our most
      anxious thoughts for months past&mdash;our third child, as we have got to
      call it&mdash;has gone out from us on this summer&rsquo;s day, to seek its
      fortune in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before twelve o&rsquo;clock last night, my husband dictated to me the
      last words of &ldquo;The Yellow Mask.&rdquo; I laid down the pen, and closed the paper
      thoughtfully. With that simple action the work that we had wrought at
      together so carefully and so long came to a close. We were both so silent
      and still, that the murmuring of the trees in the night air sounded
      audibly and solemnly in our room.
    </p>
    <p>
      William&rsquo;s collection of stories has not, thus far, been half exhausted
      yet; but those who understand the public taste and the interests of
      bookselling better than we, think it advisable not to risk offering too
      much to the reader at first. If individual opinions can be accepted as a
      fair test, our prospects of success seem hopeful. The doctor (but we must
      not forget that he is a friend) was so pleased with the two specimen
      stories we sent to him, that he took them at once to his friend, the
      editor of the newspaper, who showed his appreciation of what he read in a
      very gratifying manner. He proposed that William should publish in the
      newspaper, on very fair terms, any short anecdotes and curious experiences
      of his life as a portrait-painter, which might not be important enough to
      put into a book. The money which my husband has gained from time to time
      in this way has just sufficed to pay our expenses at the farmhouse up to
      within the last month; and now our excellent friends here say they will
      not hear anything more from us on the subject of the rent until the book
      is sold and we have plenty of money. This is one great relief and
      happiness. Another, for which I feel even more grateful, is that William&rsquo;s
      eyes have gained so much by their long rest, that even the doctor is
      surprised at the progress he has made. He only puts on his green shade now
      when he goes out into the sun, or when the candles are lit. His spirits
      are infinitely raised, and he is beginning to talk already of the time
      when he will unpack his palette and brushes, and take to his old
      portrait-painting occupations again.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all these reasons for being happy, it seems unreasonable and
      ungracious in me to be feeling sad, as I do just at this moment. I can
      only say, in my own justification, that it is a mournful ceremony to take
      leave of an old friend; and I have taken leave twice over of the book that
      has been like an old friend to me&mdash;once when I had written the last
      word in it, and once again when I saw it carried away to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      I packed the manuscript up with my own hands this morning, in thick brown
      paper, wasting a great deal of sealing-wax, I am afraid, in my anxiety to
      keep the parcel from bursting open in case it should be knocked about on
      its journey to town. Oh me, how cheap and common it looked, in its new
      form, as I carried it downstairs! A dozen pairs of worsted stockings would
      have made a larger parcel; and half a crown&rsquo;s worth of groceries would
      have weighed a great deal heavier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as we had done dinner the doctor and the editor came in. The first
      had called to fetch the parcel&mdash;I mean the manuscript; the second had
      come out with him to Appletreewick for a walk. As soon as the farmer heard
      that the book was to be sent to London, he insisted that we should drink
      success to it all round. The children, in high glee, were mounted up on
      the table, with a glass of currant-wine apiece; the rest of us had ale;
      the farmer proposed the toast, and his sailor son led the cheers. We all
      joined in (the children included), except the editor&mdash;who, being the
      only important person of the party, could not, I suppose, afford to
      compromise his dignity by making a noise. He was extremely polite,
      however, in a lofty way, to me, waving his hand and bowing magnificently
      every time he spoke. This discomposed me a little; and I was still more
      flurried when he said that he had written to the London publishers that
      very day, to prepare them for the arrival of our book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they will print it, sir?&rdquo; I ventured to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam, you may consider it settled,&rdquo; said the editor,
      confidently. &ldquo;The letter is written&mdash;the thing is done. Look upon the
      book as published already; pray oblige me by looking upon the book as
      published already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the only uncertainty now is about how the public will receive it!&rdquo;
       said my husband, fidgeting in his chair, and looking nervously at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, my dear sir, just so,&rdquo; answered the editor. &ldquo;Everything depends
      upon the public&mdash;everything, I pledge you my word of honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look doubtful, Mrs. Kerby; there isn&rsquo;t a doubt about it,&rdquo; whispered
      the kind doctor, giving the manuscript a confident smack as he passed by
      me with it on his way to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute he and the editor, and the poor cheap-looking brown
      paper parcel, were gone. The others followed them out, and I was left in
      the hall alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Public! Public! it all depends now upon you! The children are to have
      new clothes from top to toe; I am to have a black silk gown; William is to
      buy a beautiful traveling color-box; the rent is to be paid; all our kind
      friends at the farmhouse are to have little presents, and our future way
      in this hard world is to be smoothed for us at the outset, if you will
      only accept a poor painter&rsquo;s stories which his wife has written down for
      him After Dark!
